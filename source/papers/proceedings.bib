	abstract = {Assessment of the feasibility issues and fuel cycle performance of the mixed spectrum supercritical water reactor ({MS2)} has been performed. Through pitch-to-diameter ({P/D)} ratio sensitivity studies, the feasible {P/D} ratio windows for the thermal zone of the {MS2} core are sought for stainless steel and Ni-based claddings, which is large enough to provide adequate reactivity and small enough to provide an adequate heat transfer coefficient. By choosing the {P/D} ratio within the feasible windows, the {MS} 2 core has been designed and evaluated from safety and actinide management viewpoints. This core has negative moderator temperature reactivity coefficient and the shutdown margin is 1.6\% . By recycling Pu, Np and Am in the fast zone, the {MS2} concept is capable of keeping Pu, Np and Am in the reactor fuel cycle and thus eliminating them from the disposed nuclear waste.},

	title = {Improved Mesh Based Photon Sampling Techniques For Neutron Activation Analysis},
	abstract = {The design of fusion power systems requires analysis of neutron activation of large, complex volumes, and the resulting particles emitted from these volumes. Structured mesh-based discretization of these problems allows for improved modeling in these activation analysis problems. Finer discretization of these problems results in large computational costs, which drives the investigation of more efficient methods. Within an ad hoc subroutine of the Monte Carlo transport code {MCNP}, we implement sampling of voxels and photon energies for volumetric sources using the alias method. The alias method enables efficient sampling of a discrete probability distribution, and operates in O(1) time, whereas the simpler direct discrete method requires O(log(n)) time. By using the alias method, voxel sampling becomes a viable alternative to sampling space with the O(1) approach of uniformly sampling the problem volume. Additionally, with voxel sampling it is straightforward to introduce biasing of volumetric sources,
and we implement this biasing of voxels as an additional variance reduction technique that can be applied. We verify our implementation and compare the alias method, with and without biasing, to direct discrete sampling of voxels, and to uniform sampling. We study the behavior of source biasing in a second set of tests and find trends between improvements and source shape, material, and material density. Overall, however, the magnitude of improvements from source biasing appears to be limited. Future work will benefit from the implementation of efficient voxel sampling – particularly with conformal unstructured meshes where the uniform sampling approach cannot be applied.},
