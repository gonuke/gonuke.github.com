	abstract = {The Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo ({DAGMC)} software library offers a unique approach to performing neutronics analysis on {CAD-based} geometries of fusion systems. By employing a number of acceleration techniques, the ray-tracing operations that are fundamental to Monte Carlo radiation transport are implemented efficiently for direct use on the {CAD-based} solid model, eliminating the need to translate to the native Monte Carlo input language. By forming hierarchical trees of oriented bounding boxes, one for each facet that results from a high-fidelity tessellation of the model, the ray-tracing performance is adequate to permit detailed analysis of large complex systems. In addition to the reduction in human effort and improvement in quality assurance that is found in the translation approaches, the {DAGMC} approach also permits the analysis of geometries with higher order surfaces that cannot be represented by many native Monte Carlo radiation transport tools. The paper describes the various acceleration techniques and demonstrates the resulting capability in a real fusion neutronics analysis.},

With the emergence of the new clearance standards, we included both the national and international standards in our analysis and assessed the implications for the {RTL} waste stream. The 3-D spectral flux was coupled to the {ALARA} pulsed activation code to estimate the activation responses. Our results indicate that for the first time an internal component close to the target, such as the {RTL}, can be cleared from regulatory control following a storage period of 50 y after plant decommissioning. As a design requirement, the recycling process must be economically feasible, accomplished within 1.1 day with no hands-on manufacturing and in the absence of personnel access to the fabrication facility. Advanced remote handling equipment must be developed to handle a dose rate of 3000 Sv/h.},

	abstract = {Detailed activation, decay heat and waste disposal calculations of the {ARIES-AT} design are performed to evaluate the safety aspects of the device.  The high initial activity of the {SiC} highly irradiated components translates directly into a higher inititial decay heat for these structures than for the well-protected steel-based components.  However, after a one-hour cool-down period, the {SiC} decay heat drops by two decades to levels comparable to the steel-based components.  The decay heat of the {LiPb} coolant was found to exceed that of the {SiC} components for several days after shutdown.  This implies that a loss of flow accident ({LOFA)} event is more critical than a loss of coolant accident ({LOCA)} event for {LiPb/SiC} systems.  Regarding waste disposal, all structures can easily meet the Class C Low-Level Waset ({LLW)} requirements established for the {ARIES} power plants.  Many components could qualify as Class A {LLW} after a 100-year storage period after selection of low activation materials and control of the Nb and Mo impurities in ferratic steel.  A purification system will be required to remove the Po and Hg generated by Pb during operation.},

The method is designed around the power iteration method such that no additional random walks are necessary, resulting in a minimal increase in computational time. The method is implemented in the Monte Carlo N-Particle ({MCNP)} code.

While {DKR} ignored loops in the transmutation/decay scheme to preserve the exactness of the mathematical solution, {ALARA} incorporates new computational approaches without jeopardizing the most important features of {DKR's} physical modelling and mathematical methods. The physical model uses 'straightened-loop, linear chains' to achieve the same accuracy in the loop solutions as is demanded in the rest of the scheme. In cases where a chain has no loops, the exact {DKR} solution is used. Otherwise, {ALARA} adaptively chooses between a direct Laplace inversion technique and a Laplace expansion inversion technique to optimize the accuracy and speed of the solution. All of these methods result in matrix solutions which allow the fastest and most accurate solution of exact pulsing histories. Since the entire history is solved for each chain as it is created, {ALARA} achieves the optimum combination of high accuracy, high speed and low memory usage.},

The analog methodology is fully developed, including considerations for simple, complex, and loop flows, and enabling concepts such as sources and tallies. A wide variety of test problems is employed to demonstrate the validity of the analog method under various flow conditions. The method reproduced the results of the as-low-as-reasonably-achievable deterministic inventory code for comparable problems and is self-consistent when comparing complex flow scenarios to mathematically identical simple flow scenarios.

	abstract = {In order to maximise the environmental benefits of fusion power generation, it is important to clearly define the parameters governing the back-end of the materials cycle. A fusion-specific, unique approach is necessary and needs to be developed. Recycling of materials and clearance (i.e. declassification to non-radioactive material) are the two recommended options for reducing the amount of fusion waste, while disposal as low-level waste ({LLW)} could be an alternative route for specific materials and components. Both recycling and clearance criteria have been recently revised by national and international institutions. These revisions and their consequences are examined in this paper. It is also important to define processes and routes to avoid generating active waste from fusion as much as possible. Two ways are explored within the fusion community: first, to develop materials leading to low activation levels and avoiding the generation of long-lived radionuclides (this includes controlling the impurity content of the material); second, to develop suitable and reliable processes allowing either to clear or release as much material as possible (potentially after adequate treatment) or to recycle most of the remaining materials within the fusion and nuclear industry. 2008 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

The design contains many innovative features to improve both the physics and engineering performance of the system. From the safety and environmental perspective, there is greater depth to the overall analysis than in past {ARIES} studies. For {ARIES-AT}, the overall spectrum of off-normal events to be examined has been broadened. They include conventional loss of coolant and loss of flow events, an ex-vessel loss of coolant, and in-vessel off-normal events that mobilize in-vessel inventories (e.g., tritium and tokamak dust) and bypass primary confinement such as a loss of vacuum and an in-vessel loss of coolant with bypass. This broader examination of accidents improves the robustness of the design from the safety perspective and gives additional confidence that the facility can meet the no-evacuation requirement under average weather conditions. We also provide a systematic assessment of the design to address key safety functions such as confinement, decay heat removal, and chemical energy control. In the area of waste management, both the volume of the component and its hazard are used to classify the waste. In comparison to previous {ARIES} designs, the overall waste volume is less because of the compact design.},

Calculated results are compared for the bulk shield mock-up and the helium-cooled pebble bed ({HCPB)} breeder blanket mock-up, which utilize the 14-{MeV} Frascati Neutron Generator facility. Neutron flux was measured at different depths in these experimental mock-ups using activation foils that cover the neutron energy range of 0 to 14 {MeV.} Additionally, tritium production in {Li2CO3} pellets was measured in the {HCPB} experiment.

Results of the foil activation calculations for the bulk shielding experiment and the {HCPB} breeder experiment show agreement within statistical uncertainty for {DAG-MCNP5} and native {MCNP5.} Calculated results for tritium production in the {HCPB} mock-up also agree within statistical uncertainty for the {DAG-MCNP5} and native {MCNP5} calculations. Timing results showed that {DAG-MCNP5} is 5.3 times slower than native {MCNP5} for the bulk shield mock-up. For the {HCPB} mock-up, {DAG-MCNP5} is 4.8 times slower than native {MCNP5.}

It is concluded that the close agreement of calculated foil activation and tritium production between {DAG-MCNP5} and native {MCNP5} in these complex and {ITER-relevant} geometries provides additional quality assurance for the {DAG-MCNP5} code and the mcnp2cad tool used in this work.},

Recently, an initiative was launched in the {U.S.} and Europe to reduce the radwaste volume further by clearing the outer components from reuglatory control.  Vefore proceeding further with the development of a new strategy for the {U.S.} fusion waste management, it is essential to assess the implication of the clearance option on the waste generated by the {U.S.} advanced power plants.  In this paper, we discuss the results of the analysis, the approach adopted by the {ARIES} team for handling the cleared components, and the {U.S.} market for cleared metals.  Our results state that, because of the compactness of the design, none of the {ARIES-AT} fusion power core components has a clearance index below one at the end of the 100 year interim storage period and all components should be either recycled or disposed near surface as low-level waste.  At present, the {U.S.} industry has zero tolerance for metals with very low radiation level, meaning the commercial market for cleared metals does not exist.},

	abstract = {Even though a computer-aided design ({CAD)-based} geometry can be directly implemented in Geant4 as polygon-mesh using the {G4TessellatedSolid} class, the computation speed becomes very slow, especially when the geometry is composed of a large number of facets. To address this problem, in the present study, a new Geant4 solid class, named {DagSolid}, was developed based on the direct accelerated geometry for the Monte Carlo ({DAGMC)} library which provides the ray-tracing acceleration algorithm functions. To develop the {DagSolid} class, the new solid class was derived from the {G4VSolid} class, and its ray-tracing functions were linked to the corresponding functions of the {DAGMC} library. The results of this study show that the use of the {DagSolid} class drastically improves the computation speed. The improvement was more significant when there were more facets, meaning that the {DagSolid} class can be used more effectively for complicated geometries with many facets than for simple geometries. The maximum difference of computation speed was 1562 and 680 times for Geantino and {ChargedGeantino}, respectively. For real particles (gammas, electrons, neutrons, and protons), the difference of computation speed was less significant, but still was within the range of 53–685 times depending on the type of beam particles simulated.},

	abstract = {Both renewable and nuclearenergy can provide significant contributions to decarbonizing the electric sector. However, a grid employing large amounts of wind and solar energy requires the balance of the system to be highly flexible to respond to the increased variability of the net load. This makes deployment of conventional nuclear power challenging both due to the technical challenges of plant cycling and economic limits of reduced capacity factor. In the United States nuclear power plants generally provide constant, base load power and are most economic when operated at constant power levels. Operating nuclear power plants in load-following modes decreases the plants' annual energy output and increases the levelized cost of energy, decreasing economic competitiveness.

One possible solution is to couple thermalenergystorage to nuclear power plants. This would enable the reactor to remain at nearly constant output, while cycling the electrical generator in response to the variability of the net load. This paper conceptually explores combinations of wind, solar, and nuclear that can provide a large fraction of a system's electricity, assuming the use of thermalenergystorage that would allow nuclear power to provide load following and cycling duty while operating at a constant reactor power output.},

As an alternative to recycling or disposal in repositories, many countries are proceeding successfully with the process of developing clearance guidelines that allow solids and building rubble containing traces of radioisotopes to be cleared from regulatory control and unconditionally released to the commercial market after a specific storage period. With the emergence of new clearance standards, we took the initiative to compare {U.S.} to European and other international limits. This exercise is proving valuable in understanding the differences between the clearance standards and their implications for the radwaste management of fusion power plants. While clearance standards now exist for most radionuclides that are mainly important to the fission industry, no such standards are in place for many radionuclides of interest to fusion facilities. Before fusion penetrates the energy market, fusion-specific standards should be developed to address the safe release of fusion materials with trace levels of radioactive contamination.},

	title = {Feasibility of Target Materials Recycling as Waste Management Alternative},
	volume = {46},
	url = {http://epubs.ans.org/?a=586},
	abstract = {The issue of waste management has been studied simultaneously along with the development of the {ARIES} heavy-ion-driven inertial fusion energy ({IFE)} concept. Options for waste management include disposal in repositories, recycling, or clearance from regulatory control, following a reasonable cooling period. This paper concerns the feasibility of recycling the heavy-ion-beam targets, in particular the hohlraum wall materials that include, for example, {Au/Gd}, Au, W, Pb, Hg, Ta, {Pb/Ta/Cs}, {Hg/W/Cs}, {Pb/Hf}, Hf, solid Kr, and solid Xe. The choice between target material disposal and recycling depends on the amount of waste generated relative to the nuclear island, the strategy to solve the recycling problem, and the impact of the additional cost and complexity of the recycling process on the overall machine. A detailed flow diagram for the elements of the recycling process was developed to analyze two extreme activation cases: (a) one-shot use and then disposal in a repository and (b) recycling continuously during plant life without removal of transmutation products. Metrics for comparing the two scenarios included waste level, dose to recycling equipment, additional cost, and design complexity. Comparing the two approaches indicated a preference for the one-shot scenario as it generates 1 m3/yr of extremely low-level waste (Class A) and offers attractive design and economics features. Recycling reduces the target waste stream by a factor of 10 or more but introduces additional issues. It may produce high-level waste, requires remote handling, adds radioactive storage facilities, and increases the cost and complexity of the plant. The inventory analysis indicated that the heavy-ion-beam ({HIB)} target materials represent a very small waste stream compared to that of the nuclear island ({\textless}1\% of the total waste). This means recycling is not a "must" requirement for {IFE-HIB} power plants unless the target materials have cost and/or resource problems (e.g., Au and Gd). In this case, the additional cost and complexity of the recycling process should be factored into the economics of {IFE} power plants.},

	abstract = {The {ITER} blanket modules ({BM)} are geometrically complex with many water coolant channels in a {SS316} structure. Detailed mapping of nuclear heating, radiation damage, and helium production is an essential input to the design process. Previous high fidelity, high-resolution results calculated with the {CAD} based {DAG-MCNP} code revealed important heterogeneity effects on nuclear heating and helium production near steel/water interfaces. We carried out additional analysis for a simplified geometry to understand the reasons behind the observed peaking in the steel nuclear parameters at the interface with the water coolant. The results show that the peaking in nuclear heating is due to the softer neutron spectrum in the portion of steel adjacent to water which results in more gamma generation. Helium production peaking in steel adjacent to the water is due to the softer neutron spectrum which results in increased helium production primarily in B-10 impurities present in the {SS316} in addition to a two-step reaction of low-energy neutrons with Ni.},

	abstract = {Efficient burn up of minor actinides is one of the most promising alternatives for minimizing waste in advanced nuclear fuel cycles. This work examines the concept of employing Z-pinch driven fusion source in a sub-critical transmutation reactor designed to burn up actinides and generate constant power. Its fuel cycle is designed to allow on-line fission product removal and fuel replenishment. The variation of the actinide inventory is an essential quantity used to calculate the energy multiplications and neutron spectrum, as well as to design an appropriate reactivity control mechanism.

In this paper we develop a method to calculate timedependent isotopic distributions, fuel feeding rate and fission product removal rate necessary to obtain a constant power level. The calculation is performed by using both {MCise}, a Monte Carlo isotopic inventory code, and {MCNP5.} An important feature of {MCise} for this system is the ability to simulate the on-line removal of fission products from the actinide mixture.

In addition to reporting the actinide inventory and burn rates, the impact of the actinide inventory on the fission/fusion energy multiplication will be examined.},

	abstract = {The immense size and complex geometry of the {ITER} experimental fusion reactor require the development of special techniques that can accurately and efficiently perform neutronics simulations with minimal human effort. This paper shows the effect of the hybrid Monte Carlo ({MC)/deterministic} techniques - Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling ({CADIS)} and Forward-Weighted {CADIS} ({FW-CADIS)} - in enhancing the efficiency of the neutronics modeling of {ITER} and demonstrates the applicability of coupling these methods with computer-aided-design-based {MC.} Three quantities were calculated in this analysis: the total nuclear heating in the inboard leg of the toroidal field coils ({TFCs)}, the prompt dose outside the biological shield, and the total neutron and gamma fluxes over a mesh tally covering the entire reactor. The use of {FW-CADIS} in estimating the nuclear heating in the inboard {TFCs} resulted in a factor of [approximately]275 increase in the {MC} figure of merit ({FOM)} compared with analog {MC} and a factor of [approximately]9 compared with the traditional methods of variance reduction. By providing a factor of [approximately]21 000 increase in the {MC} {FOM}, the radiation dose calculation showed how the {CADIS} method can be effectively used in the simulation of problems that are practically impossible using analog {MC.} The total flux calculation demonstrated the ability of {FW-CADIS} to simultaneously enhance the {MC} statistical precision throughout the entire {ITER} geometry. Collectively, these calculations demonstrate the ability of the hybrid techniques to accurately model very challenging shielding problems in reasonable execution times.},

It uses the high temperature {SiC/SiC} for structural material and {LiPb} for coolant-breeder. Due to the large difference between the time scale of plasma shutdown and the coolant or power loss, it is assumed that the plasma is immediately quenched at the onset of the {LOCA/LOFA} and the chamber components' temperature begins to rise due to the decay heat generated. A 2-D transient finite element model is established to examine the thermal behavior of the in-vessel components to determine the maximum temperature reached, the time, and duration of the peak. The model is axisymmetric in (r-z) around the reactor axis to show the details of temperature distribution in the vertical direction. The vacuum vessel is assumed adiabatic in the inboard side and radiates to the maintenance port located on the outboard side. The maximum temperature of steel in the reactor is about (600 {°C} - {700°C)} after about 4 days from the onset of the accident. The highest temperature in the reactor is in the divertor region and it reaches {1050°C} after about 2-3 hours. The analysis indicates that the reactor does not need any special scheme for decay heat removal.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility ({IFMIF)} is to provide irradiation conditions of a typical deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion reactor for small material samples, but with higher irradiation levels. An extensive code and data development has been performed, allowing a comprehensive neutronic analysis of the high-flux test volume. New data evaluations for neutron interactions and responses at high energies (20 to 50 {MeV)} were performed and processed, and a Monte Carlo neutron source model for the Li(d,xn) reaction was developed for use with the {MCNP} neutron transport code.

The neutron flux density was found to be {\textgreater}1014 ncm-2s-1 throughout the anticipated high-flux test volume with a high-energy fraction ({\textgreater}14 {MeV)} of {\textasciitilde}20\%. The available test volume with {\textgreater}20 dpa/full-power year in iron was found to be 550 ± 180 cm3. This uncertainty is due almost entirely to the uncertainty in the total neutron yield. Hydrogen and helium production rates were calculated and a helium/dpa ratio between 10 and 12 appm/dpa was found, which is similar to that found in a D-T fusion reactor. {IFMIF} was found to provide an adequate environment for the simulation of D-T fusion reactors, but more work is required to extend and improve the current data and tools.},

	abstract = {Three variance reduction techniques for the ongoing development of Monte Carlo isotopic inventory analysis are implemented as alternatives to improve the precision of Monte Carlo simulations. The Forced Reaction technique is designed to force an atom to undergo a predefined number of reactions in a given control volume. Biased Reaction Branching is primarily focused on improving statistical results of the isotopes that are produced from rare reaction pathways. Biased Source Sampling is aimed at increasing frequencies of sampling rare initial isotopes as the starting Monte Carlo particles. A variety of test problems is uniquely designed to demonstrate the validity and the improvement, relative to the analog problem, of each technique. The increases in precision due to the variance reduction techniques usually come at the expense of longer computing times per history.

A figure of merit ({FOM)} is developed as a tool to monitor the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations with variance reduction schemes. A number of statistical characteristics of Monte Carlo isotopic inventory calculations are used to construct a variety of {FOM} formulations. Two of them offer robust {FOMs:} one based on the relative error of a known target isotope ({1/R2T)} and one based on the overall detection limit corrected by the relative error ({1/DkR2T).}

Figures of merit are later used to quantitatively assess the efficiencies of Monte Carlo simulations under different scopes of interest. Given a defined set of variance reduction parameters to produce desired effects, the efficiency measurements from an {FOM} agree with the expected performance.},

A variation of this configuration utilizes 40 neutron traps attached to the inner surface of the biological shield behind the {GIMMs.} It is concluded that the shielding configuration with all optics including the {GIMM} being fully enclosed in the biological shield is the preferred option since it results in the lowest nuclear environment at the dielectric mirrors, provides better {GIMM} support, reduces the volume to be maintained under vacuum, and requires the least amount of concrete shield.},

	abstract = {Over the past 5-6 decades, stellarator power plants have been studied in the {US}, Europe, and Japan as an alternate to the mainline magnetic fusion tokamaks, offering steady-state operation and eliminating the risk of plasma disruptions. The earlier 1980s studies suggested large-scale stellarator power plants with an average major radius exceeding 20 m. The most recent development of the compact stellarator concept delivered {ARIES-CS} - a compact stellarator with 7.75 m average major radius, approaching that of tokamaks. For stellarators, the most important engineering parameter that determines the machine size and cost is the minimum distance between the plasma boundary and mid-coil. Accommodating the breeding blanket and necessary shield within this distance to protect the {ARIES-CS} superconducting magnet represents a challenging task. Selecting the {ARIES-CS} nuclear and engineering parameters to produce an economic optimum, modeling the complex geometry for {3D} nuclear analysis to confirm the key parameters, and minimizing the radwaste stream received considerable attention during the design process. These engineering design elements combined with advanced physics helped enable the compact stellarator to be a viable concept. This paper provides a brief historical overview of the progress in designing stellarator power plants and a perspective on the successful integration of the nuclear activity into the final {ARIES-CS} configuration.},

	abstract = {In the aftermath of the March 2011 accident at Japan?s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the future contribution of nuclear power to the global energy supply has become somewhat uncertain. Because nuclear power is an abundant, low-carbon source of base-load power, it could make a large contribution to mitigation of global climate change and air pollution. Using historical production data, we calculate that global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of {CO2-equivalent} ({GtCO2-eq)} greenhouse gas ({GHG)} emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning. On the basis of global projection data that take into account the effects of the Fukushima accident, we find that nuclear power could additionally prevent an average of 420?000?7.04 million deaths and 80?240 {GtCO2-eq} emissions due to fossil fuels by midcentury, depending on which fuel it replaces. By contrast, we assess that large-scale expansion of unconstrained natural gas use would not mitigate the climate problem and would cause far more deaths than expansion of nuclear power.},

Unfortunately, these codes all make physical and mathematical approximations in order to turn a functionally infinite and highly complicated problem into a more manageable, simple problem. This paper examines these approximations, namely, the handling of loops in the decay scheme, the truncation of the decay scheme, and the modeling of pulsed/intermittent operation histories, as physical approximations and the choice of a solution method as a mathematical approximation. The final recommendation is a code that uses an exact representation of the pulsing history, handles loops by unraveling, truncates the decay schemes with a relative sub-tree production rule modified by a stable truncation restriction and uses an adaptively chosen analytical or Laplace inverse mathematical solution method.},

In addition, total nuclear heating values in the inboard magnet and central solenoid were examined for straight and stepped vertical gaps and for combined horizontal and vertical straight gaps. The results show significant radiation streaming effects that are more pronounced for fast neutron fluence and helium production. Furthermore, it was found that stepping the gap significantly reduces the local peaking, but has little effect on the relative average values of radiation effects.

The objective of this assessment is to identify the radiological issues of the candidate liquid wall materials (Pb, {LiPb}, Sn, and Flibe) using the {ARIES-IFE} radiation chamber environment. The issues to be addressed include the radioactivity level and liquid waste minimization for waste management. Specifically, the liquids are evaluated with regard to the Class C limitation for waste disposal, a top-level requirement for all {ARIES} power plant designs. Two extreme cases were analyzed; the worst case is separation of the liquid wall material (highest radiation exposure) and the breeder (lowest radiation exposure), and the best case is the mixing of the two liquid streams. Both tangential and porous wall injection schemes were examined. Pb and {LiPb} are more radioactive than Sn and Flibe. For the liquid breeder system, the porous wall injection scheme with mixed liquid flows results in the lowest waste disposal rating and smallest waste stream achieved in our study.},

	abstract = {Designers of heavy ion ({HI)} and Z-pinch inertial fusion power plants have explored the potential of recycling the target and recyclable transmission line ({RTL)} materials as an alternate option to disposal in a geological repository. This work represents the first time a comprehensive recycling assessment was performed on both machines with an exact pulse history. Our results offer two divergent conclusions on the recycling issue. For the {HI} concept, target recycling is not a “must” requirement and the preferred option is the one-shot use scenario as target materials represent a small waste stream, less than 1\% of the total nuclear island waste. We recommend using low-cost hohlraum materials once-through and then disposing of them instead of recycling expensive materials such as Au and Gd. On the contrary, {RTL} recycling is a “must” requirement for the Z-pinch concept in order to minimize the {RTL} inventory and enhance the economics. The {RTLs} meet the low level waste and recycling dose requirements with a wide margin when recycled for the entire plant life even without a cooling period. While recycling offers advantages to the Z-pinch system, it adds complexity and cost to the {HI} designs.},

power plant design with a very low projected cost of

performance of the system. From the safety and environmental perspective, there is greater depth to the
overall analysis than in past {ARIES} studies. For
{ARIES-AT}, the overall spectrum of off-normal events to be examined has been broadened. They include conventional loss of coolant and loss of flow events, an ex-vessel loss of coolant, and in-vessel off-normal events that mobilize in-vessel inventories (e.g. tritium and tokamak dust) and bypass primary confinement such as a Loss of Vacuum and an in-vessel loss of
coolant with bypass. This broader examination of
accidents improves the robustness of the design from the safety perspective and gives additional confidence that the facility can meet the no-evacuation
requirement. We also provide a systematic assessment of the design to address key safety functions such as confinement, decay heat removal, and chemical energy
control. In the area of waste management, waste is classified by both the volume of the component and its
hazard. In comparison to previous {ARIES} designs, the overall waste volume is less because of the compact design.},

Using Direct Accelerated Geometry ({DAG)-MCNPX}, a coupling of traditional {MCNPXwith} the Common Geometry Module ({CGM)} and the Mesh Oriented {dAtaBase} ({MOAB)} developed at {UW}, high-fidelity 3-D neutronics analysis is now possible. Particles are transported in the {CAD} geometry reducing analysis time, eliminating input error, and preserving geometric detail. The surface source read-write capability that exists in {MCNPX} has been used in {DAG-MCNPX} to combine realistic source conditions with an efficient analysis model. A surface source was written using a 3-D model of {ITER} with a detailed plasma source. The surface source was then used in a detailed 3-D {CAD} model of Module 13. 3-D high fidelity mesh tallies were used to calculate nuclear heating used in thermal-hydraulics analysis. Surface source results were compared against results using a hybrid 1-D/3-D approach in which a uniform neutron source is extended infinitely in the vertical direction. Results show that the hybrid source overestimated the total number and underestimated the average energy of particles incident on the {FW.} The hybrid approach was found to overestimate the nuclear heating at the front of the first wall by as much as 63\%.},

This change, in concert with the overall departure from light water reactor technology, will drive a change in the regulatory framework for both Generation {IV} reactors and fusion power plants of the future. Further, both fission and fusion power plants will have to compete in similar future energy markets with uncertainties in energy prices and the development of alternative energy products.

A distinct difference between {ARIES-RS} and {ARIES-AT} plasmas is the higher plasma elongation of {ARIES-AT} (κx\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;2.2) which is the result of a “thinner” blanket leading to a large increase in plasma β to 9.2\% (compared to 5\% for {ARIES-RS)} with only a slightly higher {βN.} {ARIES-AT} blanket is a simple, low-pressure design consisting of {SiC} composite boxes with a {SiC} insert for flow distribution that does not carry any structural load. The breeding coolant ({Pb–17Li)} enters the fusion core from the bottom, and cools the first wall while traveling in the poloidal direction to the top of the blanket module. The coolant then returns through the blanket channel at a low speed and is superheated to {∼1100\&\#xa0;°C.} As most of the fusion power is deposited directly into the breeding coolant, this method leads to a high coolant outlet temperature while keeping the temperature of the {SiC} structure as well as interface between {SiC} structure and {Pb–17Li} to about {1000\&\#xa0;°C.} This blanket is well matched to an advanced Brayton power cycle, leading to an overall thermal efficiency of ∼59\%. The very low afterheat in {SiC} composites results in exceptional safety and waste disposal characteristics. All of the fusion core components qualify for shallow land burial under {U.S.} regulations (furthermore, ∼90\% of components qualify as Class-A waste, the lowest level). The {ARIES-AT} study shows that the combination of advanced tokamak modes and advanced technology leads to an attractive fusion power plant with excellent safety and environmental characteristics and with a cost of electricity ({4.7\&\#xa0;¢/kWh)}, which is competitive with those projected for other sources of energy.},

A fusion-specific approach is necessary and needs to be developed. Recycling of materials and clearance (i.e. declassification to non-radioactive material) are the two recommended options for reducing the amount of fusion waste, while the disposal as low-level waste could be an alternative route for specific materials and components. Both recycling and clearance criteria have been recently revised by national and international institutions. These revisions and their consequences for fusion material management are examined in this paper. It is also important to define the various processes and routes to avoid generating active waste from fusion as much as possible. Two ways are explored within the fusion community: first, the development of materials leading to low activation levels, avoiding the generation of long lived radionuclides through a strict control of the impurity content in materials; second, the development of suitable and reliable processes allowing either clearance of as much material as possible (potentially after adequate treatment) or recycling most of the remaining materials within the nuclear industry.},

	abstract = {Developments in computer architecture and neutronics code capabilities have enabled high-resolution analysis of complex {3D} geometries. Thus, accurately modeling {3D} source distributions has become important for nuclear analyses. In this work two methods are described which generate and sample such {3D} sources based directly on the plasma parameters of a fusion device and which facilitate the ability to update the neutron source following changes to the plasma physics configuration. The cylindrical mesh method is for toroidally symmetric machines and utilizes data in a standard file format which represents the poloidal magnetic flux on an R-Z grid. The conformal hexahedral mesh method takes plasma physics data generated in an idealized toroidal coordinate system and uses a Jacobian transformation and a functional expansion to generate the source. This work describes each methodology and associated test cases. The cylindrical mesh method was applied to {ARIES-RS} and the conformal hexahedral mesh method was applied to a uniform torus and {ARIES-CS.} The results of the test cases indicate that these improved source definitions can have important effects on pertinent engineering parameters, such as neutron wall loading, and should therefore be used for high-resolution nuclear analyses of all toroidal devices. 2009 Elsevier {B.V.}},

	abstract = {Detailed three-dimensional nuclear analyses have been carried out for the chamber of a power plant concept that utilizes the Z-Pinch driven inertial confinement technology with a target yield of 3 {GJ} and repetition rate of 0.1 Hz per chamber. The elliptical chamber concept was modeled with the double-layered Recyclable Transmission Lines ({RTL).} Thick liquid jets are utilized to breed tritium, absorb energy, and shield the chamber wall. Two liquid breeder options were considered; the molten salt Flibe and the {LiPb} eutectic (Li {17Pb83).} The chamber wall is made of the low activation ferritic steel alloy {F82H.} While both breeders have the potential for achieving tritium self-sufficiency, the thermal power is 6.5\% higher with {LiPb.} However, a 55\% thicker jet zone is required with {LiPb} to provide adequate chamber wall shielding. A thicker chamber wall is required with {LiPb} to reduce the nuclear energy leakage below 1\%. The chamber wall does not need replacement except for the top part around the jet nozzles. Helium production in the chamber wall protected by {LiPb} is much lower than that with Flibe. Rewelding is possible only in the lower part of chamber wall below the pool.},

	abstract = {This study explores the boundaries of electric industry fuel switching in response to {US} carbon constraints. A ternary model quantifies how supply side compliance alternatives would change under increasingly stringent climate policies and continued growth in electricity use. Under the White House Climate Change Initiative, greenhouse gas emissions may increase and little or no change in fuel-mix is necessary. As expected, the more significant carbon reductions proposed under the Kyoto Protocol (1990—7\% levels) and Climate Stewardship Act ({CSA)} (1990 levels) require an increase of some combination of renewable, nuclear, or natural gas generated electricity. The current trend of natural gas power plant construction warrants the investigation of this technology as a sustainable carbon-mitigating measure. A detailed life-cycle assessment shows that significant greenhouse gas emissions occur upstream of the natural gas power plant, primarily during fuel-cycle operations. Accounting for the entire life-cycle increases the base emission rate for combined-cycle natural gas power by 22\%. Two carbon-mitigating strategies are tested using life-cycle emission rates developed for {US} electricity generation. Relying solely on new natural gas plants for {CSA} compliance would require a 600\% increase in natural gas generated electricity and almost complete displacement of coal from the fuel mix. In contrast, a 240\% increase in nuclear or renewable resources meets the same target with minimal coal displacement. This study further demonstrates how neglecting life-cycle emissions, in particular those occurring upstream of the natural gas power plant, may cause erroneous assessment of supply side compliance alternatives.},

The solutions to the benchmark problem for both steady-state and pulsed operation have been calculated with all three programs on the same {IBM} {RS/6000} workstation.  In addition to comparing the total activity in each of the 44 non-void zones and the isotopic contributions to the activity at a specific spatial point, the required computing time has been compared.  For the steady state problem, agreement between {ALARA} and {FISPACT-97} for the total activity was within 2.5\% in all zones at all cooling times, and within 0.5\% in most zones.  For both the steady state and pulsed problem, agreement between {ALARA} and {DKR-Pulsar} 2.0 was within 1\% in all zones and at cooling times where tritium inventories were not significant.  The agreement between {ALARA} and {FISPACT-97} for the individidual isotopic inventories in the stainless steel first wall backplate were within 1\% for all dominant isotopes at all cooling times, while the {DKR-Pulsar} 2.0 results showed some significant discrepancies.  The processing time for {ALARA} is 2/3 of that for {DKR-Pulsar} 2.0 and less than 1/5 of that for {FISPACT-97.}  The validation exercise proves that {ALARA} is an accurate and fast computational tool for the calculation of induced activity power systems.},
