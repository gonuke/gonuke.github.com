A supercritical water loop, designed to measure neutron radiolysis, is currently installed at the University of Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor ({UWNR).} Although the purpose of this loop is to determine radiolytic yields caused by neutrons alone, its proximity to the core results in large gamma doses as well as neutron doses. A shield has been designed to maximize the neutron-to-gamma dose in the irradiation volume of the supercritical water radiolysis experiment. This shield requires both an axial and a radial component and achieves a neutron-to-gamma dose ratio of 2:1. A further reduction in gamma dose could probably be achieved by reconfiguring the {UWNR} core},

	title = {Improved Mesh Based Photon Sampling Techniques For Neutron Activation Analysis},
	abstract = {The design of fusion power systems requires analysis of neutron activation of large, complex volumes, and the resulting particles emitted from these volumes. Structured mesh-based discretization of these problems allows for improved modeling in these activation analysis problems. Finer discretization of these problems results in large computational costs, which drives the investigation of more efficient methods. Within an ad hoc subroutine of the Monte Carlo transport code {MCNP}, we implement sampling of voxels and photon energies for volumetric sources using the alias method. The alias method enables efficient sampling of a discrete probability distribution, and operates in O(1) time, whereas the simpler direct discrete method requires O(log(n)) time. By using the alias method, voxel sampling becomes a viable alternative to sampling space with the O(1) approach of uniformly sampling the problem volume. Additionally, with voxel sampling it is straightforward to introduce biasing of volumetric sources,
and we implement this biasing of voxels as an additional variance reduction technique that can be applied. We verify our implementation and compare the alias method, with and without biasing, to direct discrete sampling of voxels, and to uniform sampling. We study the behavior of source biasing in a second set of tests and find trends between improvements and source shape, material, and material density. Overall, however, the magnitude of improvements from source biasing appears to be limited. Future work will benefit from the implementation of efficient voxel sampling – particularly with conformal unstructured meshes where the uniform sampling approach cannot be applied.},

Further analysis supports a basis for development of rapid abstracted models in the context of system level fuel cycle simulation. Processes and parameters found to influence repository perfor- mance include the rate of waste form degradation, timing of waste package failure, and various coupled geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of the natural system including dif- fusion, solubility, and advection.},

	abstract = {One of the Generation {IV} reactor designs, the supercritical water reactor ({SCWR)}, has the potential to surpass efficiency of current light water reactors by 30\%. Before building a power plant, radiolytic breakdown of water and resulting corrosion at high temperatures and pressures must be known. Some results have been achieved in both a neutron-gamma loop at the University of Wisconsin and a pulse radiolysis experiment at Argonne National Laboratory. In addition to providing guidance with respect to water chemistry for corrosion experiments at supercritical water conditions, the results are used to validate computational models of radiation chemistry and it is used to predict the behavior of various materials in supercritical water reactors},

	abstract = {Detailed reactor models, massively parallelized calculations, and enormously collaborative simulation projects are increas- ingly integral to nuclear engineering. However, the quality and caliber of this work is limited by a workforce lacking formal training in a software development skill suite that is becom- ing increasingly essential. To address this unmet need, The Hacker Within ({THW)}, a student organization at the University of Wisconsin, has developed a series of short courses address- ing best practices such as version control and test driven code development, as well as basic skills such as {UNIX} mobility. These {‘Boot} Camps’ seek to provide time efficient introduc- tions to essential programming languages and tools without turning “biochemists and mechanical engineers into computer scientists.”[1][2]},
