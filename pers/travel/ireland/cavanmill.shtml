<P>The old mill in Cavan was recently bought by Lifeforce, a natural food
producer, and restored to its original working condition. Although it was
originally used to mill oats, because they were the local crop, it is now
used to mill wheat for making bread. In fact, Lifeforce sells both the
whole-meal flour and the whole-meal bread which it bakes with that flour.</P>

<P>One of the attractions of the Cavan Lifeforce Mill is a bread-making
tour. The tour starts upstairs in a big kitchen where each visitor gets
to mix their own bread batter following a standard Irish whole-meal soda
bread recipe. Once all the batter has been mixed, it is put in loaf pans
and taken to the ovens. Then, while the bread bakes, the visitors get to
tour the entire mill from where the grain is delivered, through the storage
and drying areas, and into the milling area itself.</P>

<P>Rather than a water wheel, this mill is powered by a water turbine,
and is the oldest operating water turbine mill in Ireland. In case of low
water flow, the back up system is a big old deisel engine. This has been
supplemented even further with an electric back-up system which, due to
low rainfall powers the mill most of the time. Being the geeky engineer
that I&nbsp;am, I&nbsp;was fascinated by the mill wheels, the water trubine
and the old deisel engine. The deisel engine was particularly interesting
because of a laboratory course which I&nbsp;had in Toronto. This so-called
&quot;Heat Engines&quot;&nbsp;lab was full of old heavy stationary engines
which were originally used for factory and mill work. They were a perfect
learning tool because they are not modified with the various bells and
whistles of modern motors and engines. Seeing one of these installed in
its original environment was cool.</P>
