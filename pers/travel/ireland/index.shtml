<P>We spent two weeks in Ireland, traveling from one Bed &amp; Breakfast
(B&amp;B) to another and exploring the Irish countryside. We reserved all
of our B&amp;B's ahead of time and only had to change one night (thanks
to terrible weather and canceled events). Our primary activity was to walk
up, down, around, through, over, between, and on as many pieces of Irish
land as we could. We supplemented this with one afternoon on horseback
in the southwest. The weather was glorious for our first day, suddenly
becoming absolutely dismal, and then gradually improved. It didn't hamper
too many of our plans. Our last few nights were in Dublin, a very lively
and happening city - including the last night when we were shown around
to a few of the local hangouts by a Laurie's sister's friend who lives
there. Other than breakfast and Guinness (sweet nectar of the gods), the
culinary experience was not quite that of Italy: nothing spectacular but
the prices. At most of the B&amp;B's, the breakfast was a so-called "Full
Irish Breakfast": cereal and OJ, egg, bacon, sausage, pudding (sausage
relative), toast, whole- meal brown bread. It was generally enough to keep
us going until dinner.</P>

<P>The first weekend was rather a slow start to our holiday, with failed
plans and failing weather.</P>

<P>Although the weather didn't improve quickly, we did our best to ignore
our days in Southwest Ireland.</P>

<P>We finally had a little sun, and quickly took advantage of it in various
counties of Norhtwest Ireland.</P>

<P>We ended our wonderful vacation in Dublin, a big difference from the
quiet and remote extents of Ireland.</P>

<P>As you may have gathered, food and culture did not dominate this trip
as they did in Italy. This was more an exploration of natural beauty throughout
the Irish countryside, and, in particular, on the coast from Bantry Bay
in the Southwest all the way to Inishowen in the North. I strongly recommend
a visit to anyone who has the time to spend. The landscape is surprisingly
varied for such a small island (spoken like a true Canadian), so a tour
as we did was interesting. On the other hand, if I went back, I would stay
in one or two areas so that I could explore them more properly, perhaps
even taking one of the many walking routes (100-200 km) which are well
documented and signposted. </P>
