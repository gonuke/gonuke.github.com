<P>The drive from Killarney to Glengarrif on the N71 takes you through
the breathtaking Killarnet National Park. This park epitomises the &quot;green-ness&quot;
of Ireland and includes many ups and downs through the mountains of this
region. This is also the first leg of the Ring of Kerry (assuming a clockwise
start in Killarney). The rode wind around rocks, along lakes, up hills
and through natural arches. Even on the foul grey and overcast day on which
we experienced it, it was magnificent. The climax of the drive is Moll's
Gap, which, even at only about 250 m, offers an amazing view of the valley
which you have just traversed.</P>
