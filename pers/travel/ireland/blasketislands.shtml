<P>The Blasket Islands are 4 or 5 small islands at the end of the Dingle
Peninsula. The largest is Great Blasket Island, which was home to a large
population of Irish speaking people until the middle of this century. The
Blasket Islanders had a thriving culture, and were visited by many a scholar
to learn Irish and capture the culture. Interestingly, because of many
years of imposed education in English, many of the Blasket Islanders were
illiterate in their native tongue. It was only at the urging of these visiting
foreign scholars, some from as far away as Sweden, that the islanders began
to write in Irish. &nbsp;Since then, many famous Irish books, some autobiographical,
have originated from the island.</P>

<P>Due to the extreme weather, passage to the mainland was only possible
on less than half the days of the year. If they were lucky, some of these
days were Sundays so that the entire population could make the trip to
church in Dunquin. This connection to Dunquin was also the source of new
islanders through marriage, allowing the population to grow and survive.
The men spent most days on the water fishing and collecting lobster traps.
The women tended the livestock and collected the peat which was burned
for fuel. The islanders chose a so-called &quot;King&quot;&nbsp;as their
leader who was responsible for many decisions on the island.</P>

<P>The isolation also meant that life on the island was dangerous. The
island life was also not very attractive to the young people growing up
on the island. The population slowly dwindled until in 1953, when there
were no more young women in the island's community, the island was evacuated
for the safety of its residents. The catalyst for this evacuation was the
death of an islander who couldn't get medical attention because of bad
weather preventing a crossing from the mainland.</P>

<P>Because of the importance of the island in the history of Irish language
literature, this museum also has lots of information about the Irish language
itself. In addition to sculptures of various things (birds, water, clouds,
animals) along the walls of the main corridor with their Irish name engraved
within, there was information about the origin of the language and its
relationship to other languages like Welsh, Gaellic, and Manx. In addition
to all this, was a wall of televisions showing a elementary school class
learning various vocabulary in Irish.</P>
