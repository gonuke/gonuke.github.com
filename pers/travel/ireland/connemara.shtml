<CENTER><P>Here we cross the bogs in the direction of Mt. Diamond hidden
in the clouds. While it may appear<BR>
to be a nice thickly carpeted meadow, this field is actually a soft sponge-like
peat bog, and with every<BR>
step comes the risk of a filthy wet foot!</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Connemara National Park has a lot to offer any visitor. As it
happens, about 40 other French and Italian<BR>
tourists knew this. There is a small museum which includes information
about the physical and human<BR>
history of the bogs. In addition, there are interpretive walks, A/V&nbsp;presentations,
and interesting talks about<BR>
a variety of topics, including the Connemara ponies. These horses first
arrived in the area following a<BR>
Spanish shipwreck of Ireland's West coast, and have developed into their
own breed. Gene, our<BR>
<A HREF="horseback.shtml">horseback guide</A>, has one purebred Connemara
which he is hoping to breed and use in <A HREF="http://www.iol.ie/kerry-insight/blackvalley/index.shtml">his
riding<BR>
business</A>.</P></CENTER>
