<CENTER><P>This passage tomb was recently excavated. Although not clear
here, the width of <BR>
the top stone is roughly 4 ft. Many other such tombs, some surrounded by
<A HREF="stonecircles.shtml">stone circles</A> were found<BR>
at this same site, Carrowmore, near Sligo Town in Northwest Ireland (Co.
Sligo).</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>No-one is absolutely clear about how and why such tombs were
built. It is clear that not everyone<BR>
got such a tomb. In the case of this ancient graveyard, this tomb was believed
to be the most important,<BR>
both because of its location&nbsp;(it was centrally located on the highest
part of the area) and the fact that<BR>
most, if not all, of the other tombs' opennings pointed to this tomb.</P></CENTER>
