<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Night Out in Dublin</H1>

<hr>


<P>For various reasons, it has been a long time since Laurie and I&nbsp;have
really gone out on the town. Since we had to get up and drive to the Airport
at 5 in the morning, this was probably not the best night to start....</P>

<P>We met at <I>Oliver St. John Gogarty's</I>, coincidentally the same
place that the <A HREF="music.shtml">Musical Pub Crawl</A> began. It turns
out that it is not only a bar for tourists, but also frequented by a lot
of people who live in Dublin. We stayed there for much of the evening just
chatting over a few pints and meeting a few of Tracy and Shannon's friends.
When closing time arrived, Shannon was missing because she had been persuaded
to run off to the grand opening of the <I>All Sports Caf&eacute;</I>, just
across the street. It seems that they knew a local shopowner who had been
bought out by the developer in order to build this restaurant/bar. By the
time we arrived, after closing time of the pubs, there was nearly no-one
there. I will leave it up to you to decide whether you think it was highly
exclusive or really lame!</P>

<P>After a couple of glasses of champagne with the <I>All Sports Caf&eacute;'s</I>
owners, we escaped to another bar known to locals as an after-hour bar.
These are the places where Dublin residents go after the pubs are closed
(about midnight) to get away from all the tourists. Tracy and Shannon were
regulars, so we managed to get in with no trouble, despite our tourist-like
apparel (I&nbsp;was wearing shorts, as always, not necessarily meeting
the dresscode of many a place).</P>

<P>We eventually tore ourselves away, after quite a bit to drink, at 2
AM, and took a cab home. The worst part of the whole night was getting
up three hours later. We both felt absolutely terrible and the flight to
Edinburgh was not the most pleasant I&nbsp;have had :)</P>
