<CENTER><P>This stone circle was found near Sligo&nbsp;Town in Co. Sligo.
We searched for such a thing early on our trip<BR>
while in Glengariff, but only found something about 10 ft in diameter with
rocks that were so small<BR>
and covered, it wasn't really clear what or who might have put them there.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>This circle was part of an ancient burial ground which contained
many such &quot;megalithic&quot; structures including<BR>
recently excavated <A HREF="passagetomb.shtml">passage tomb</A>. While many
of the structures were either a stone circle or a partially<BR>
burried tomb, there was one impressive example of a complete structure
with both a large passage tomb<BR>
and a significant stone circle. Unfortunately, we ran out of film before
finding it.</P></CENTER>
