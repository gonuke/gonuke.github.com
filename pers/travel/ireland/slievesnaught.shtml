<P>This walk really included three different peaks, <A HREF="deceptheights.shtml">Damph</A>
(~400m), Slieve Main (~500m) and Slieve Snaught (~600 m). We hiked them
in this order and both valleys between were 100m down and 200m back up.
The top of Slieve Snaught is covered with stones, many of which have been
formed into Cairns by people over the ages. I like to believe that many
of them were built by local youths who participated in a yearly pilgrimage
to this peak as a social event until the beginning of this century.</P>

<P>A view from the top of Slieve Snaught<BR>
(600 m) including the many cairns made<BR>
from scree in the foreground.</P>

<P>This view is looking NNE<BR>
(towards Carndonagh). The Atlantic Ocean<BR>
was visible, but you can see how the<BR>
view was obstructed by the haze.</P>
