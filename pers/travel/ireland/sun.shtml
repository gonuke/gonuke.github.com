<P>When the sun was shining on Thursday morning, we knew the time was right
for our first walk from the book: <A HREF="cliffsmoher.shtml">the Cliffs
of Moher<A HREF="cliffsmoher.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>.
And believe it or not, the clouds stayed away! We parked at the visitors'
centre for the Cliffs and walked about 5 km along the cliffs to the north.
The path was often treacherous and, at one point, was completely washed
out. At their highest point, the cliffs are about 200 m straight above
the Atlantic ocean, and slowly descend to nearly sea level at the point
where we turned around. The cliffs and jagged rock islands below create
ominous vistas as we walked above them. I felt I had used up all my concentration
already, so we walked back to the car along some inland roads. That evening
we continued north to Cleggan in the Connemara region, known for its horses
and peat bogs. </P>

<P><A HREF="microfauna.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/ireland/30.jpg" HEIGHT=252 WIDTH=188 ALIGN=LEFT></A>On
Friday, we were determined to follow our success on the Cliffs of Moher
with a more substantial hike up 3 of "The Twelve Bens" in Connemara. The
low clouds soon put a stop to that and we opted for a guided nature walk
in <A HREF="connemara.shtml">Connemara National Park<A HREF="connemara.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>
(perhaps we could learn about the bogs). When the other 40 people met for
the tour, however, we bailed out and asked one of the park staff for a
suggestion. Confident that the clouds would lift enough for Mt. Diamond
we set out in the light drizzle. After about 1 km, my left foot plunged
calf deep into a bog-hole and I my otherwise waterproof-boot protected
foot was soaked through! Not to worry, we continued on. At 300 m we had
to decide whether to climb further or make the return trip on the other
side of the hill. The clouds, which had been rising with us until then,
came down to meet us and make our decision easier. As luck would have it,
during our drive to our next destination, Drumshanbo, the sun came out
and it turned into a beautiful day. </P>

<P>On Saturday morning, although not raining, the sun was once again hidden
behind a blanket of low clouds, thwarting our hopes of another climb. Instead
we took the cultural approach, visiting sites from three very different
eras. The first was a castle which was originally built by an Irish lord
who was executed for betraying the English monarchy (Elizabeth I, if memory
serves) and was then renovated and inhabited by an English lord. <A HREF="passagetomb.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/ireland/27.jpg" HEIGHT=148 WIDTH=226 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>An
A/V presentation here directed us to a prehistoric site a few miles away
with numerous stone circles and passage tombs. You may remember the rather
dissatisfying experience of searching for the stone circle in Glengarrif.
This made up for it. These <A HREF="stonecircles.shtml">stone circles<A HREF="stonecircles.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>
were clearly made by higher intelligence (stone age man) and there were
some amazing examples of large and complete megalithic structures. The
last stop for the day was the Belleek pottery just inside the Northern
Ireland border. While the craftsmanship which goes into the making of this
woven and slip-moulded porcelain is monumental, neither Laurie nor I was
particularly impressed. To us, the styles were old-fashioned and the porcelain
looked like something that you would buy at a flea market somewhere. We
finished our Saturday in Letterkenny with the Mr. Bean movie. </P>

morning was another day for a walk from the book, and this time the weather
co-operated. We drove further north in Co. Donegal to the peninsula known
as Inishowen and climbed the triumvirate of peaks Damph (~400m), Slieve
Main (~500m) and <A HREF="slievesnaught.shtml">Slieve Snaught<A HREF="slievesnaught.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>
(~600 m). Although the sky was a glorious blue, there was haze on the horizons,
preventing a view of the islands off the NW coast of Scotland (Islay and
Jura). We then took a short cut through Northern Island to arrive in Cavan
in the middle of the country. </P>
