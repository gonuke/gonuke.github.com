<P>The Gap on Dunloe was quite fascinating, even from the car. For others
who might visit, I would strongly suggest walking or riding a bike (or
horse)&nbsp;through the gap. In particular, if you approach from the North,
arriving at Kate Kearney's Cottage, there are many options available here.
One of the most popular options was to take a small horse-drawn buggy ride
to the end of the Gap and walk back. Many others were riding bikes, walking,
or riding horses.</P>

<P>The road winds through this narrow valley, climbing very slowly to the
pass at the southern end. It is an easy walk with many waterfalls, steep
faces, and green meadows.</P>
