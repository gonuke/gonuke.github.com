<hr>


<P>This is a perfect book for anyone wanting to see the hills of Ireland
from a quiet and solitary perspective. Seventy-six different walks are
given for a wide range of walking enthusiasts. There are one-way walks
and circular walks, steep walks and flat walks, long walks and short walks,
and combinations of all of these. Although spread throughout Ireland, most
are concentrated in the popular areas well known to tourists to Ireland:&nbsp;the
Wicklow Hills south of Dublin, Co. Kerry, Connemara, and Co. Donegal. </P>

<P>Every walk is accompanied by a fairly detailed map, based in most cases
on the ordinance survey map for that region. The route is clearly indicated
on the map and described in detail in the text. Also, for each walk, the
total distance, total ascent, and total walking time is indicated. The
walking time is based on relatively moderate speeds, and should be representative
for most casual walkers. One of the most interesting features of this book,
however, is the background which it gives for the walks. In many cases,
woven throughout the description of the route of the walk is some combination
of the political, natural and geological history.</P>

<P>Although we planned to do more, the low clouds during much of our trip
meant that we only managed two of these walks. We had planned to walk over
Purple Mountain (#30), but instead <A HREF="blackvalley.shtml">spent the
day on horseback</A>. Our guide that day, Gene Tangney, told us that the
Purple Mountain was perhaps the most beautiful walk in Ireland. He also
appeased us, confirming that with the low clouds, it would not have been
worth it. We did manage to walk the <A HREF="cliffsmoher.shtml">Cliffs of
Moher (#44)</A>, which is absolutely breathtaking, if not a little treacherous.
Our most beautiful day was spent climbing the three connected peaks of
<A HREF="slievesnaught.shtml">Damph, Slieve Main, and Slieve Snaght on Inishown
in Co. Donegal&nbsp;(#68)</A>.</P>
