<hr>


<P>When we woke up on Monday morning, the rain had virtually stopped, but
the clouds were still low and threatening. It was time to conquer the weather
and start doing what we came to do. We started with a short walk on a poorly
described trail up the hill behind our B&amp;B. I decided to do the walk
in the opposite direction to that which was described, and we are still
not sure whether or not we were successful. We were in search of a standing
stone and <A HREF="stonecircles.shtml">stone circle<A HREF="stonecircles.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>,
ancient stone monuments created by early inhabitants of the area. We did
find some stones which just might have been intentionally placed in sort
of a circle, but really weren't sure. At the top of the hill, the view
of the harbour and its islands was somewhat obscured by the low clouds
(which were responsible for the drizzle, low temperatures and literally
howling wind). We climbed back down and hopped into the car in search of
more promising locations. We went further out the Beara Peninsula to a
town that was holding a two week long "Festival of the Sea". From there,
we decided to cross to <A HREF="bereisland.shtml">Bere Island<A HREF="bereisland.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>
and walk there for the afternoon. The weather was not a lot better, but
the island was virtually deserted other than about 4 cars managing to cause
nearly constant traffic. We walked a loop of the island, climbing up to
a cross on top of the highest peak and going a little off-road on the return
trip to the ferry dock. We returned to the mainland, and drove the "Ring
of Beara". The tip of the peninsula faces Dursey Island, connected to the
mainland by Irelands only operating cable car. Our day's adventures culminated
with a drive through <A HREF="healypass.shtml">Healy Pass<A HREF="healypass.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>,
one of the most magnificent views of the whole trip. After dinner we almost
got lost in a small wooded park and had a curious encounter with a local,
but that is another story.</P>

<P><A HREF="horseback.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/ireland/8.jpg" HEIGHT=293 WIDTH=197 ALIGN=LEFT></A>On
Tuesday, we were determined to do our first walk from the book, rain or
shine. Purple mountain is the east wall of the <A HREF="gapofdunloe.shtml">Gap
of Dunloe</A>, an impressive passage through the mountains of Kerry. The
walk was to be 4 km up over the mountain and 1 <SUP>1</SUP>/<SUB>2</SUB>
back along the road through the Gap, but alas, we didn't make it. About
1 km before we got to the start of the walk, we passed a small house with
signs for horseback treks in the area. We made the executive decision,
and pulled into the <A HREF="http://www.iol.ie/kerry-insight/blackvalley/index.shtml">Black
Valley Equestrian centre</A>. Our well-travelled and interesting guide
took us on a 2 hour <A HREF="blackvalley.shtml">tour of the Black valley<A HREF="blackvalley.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>,
arguably Ireland's most remote. As it was late and we had to be on our
way, we drove through the <A HREF="gapofdunloe.shtml">Gap of Dunloe</A>,
much to the chagrin of other visitors (in fact, I felt rather guilty as
we disturbed hundreds of walkers and cyclists on the narrow road). But
with a long drive to Dingle ahead of us, we had to take the car.</P>

<P>On Wednesday morning, the weather still hadn't cleared, and any hope
of climbing the walks recommended in our book seamed slim. We drove to
<A HREF="sleahead.shtml">Slea Head<A HREF="sleahead.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>
at the end of the Dingle peninsula in search of Mt. Eagle, recommended
by Gene, our equestrian guide. We found it encased in cloud so spent some
time in <A HREF="blasketislands.shtml">an interesting museum</A> at its
base. The museum was built to celebrate the people of the Blasket Islands,
situated at the end of the Dingle peninsula. This island population had
regular contact with the mainland, but existed as a very close- knit and
autonomous community until its population dwindled and it was evacuated
in 1953. When we were finished there, the top of <A HREF="mteagle.shtml">Mt.
Eagle<A HREF="mteagle.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A></A>
was visible, <A HREF="weteagle.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/ireland/20.jpg" HEIGHT=294 WIDTH=198 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>so
we wasted no time in buying an Ordinance Survey map and headed for the
base of the hill. We climbed along a creek for a couple of hours going
up gradually to a ridge at about 450 m. On the other side of the ridge,
it dropped off steeply to the centre of the peninsula with a small lake
in the bowl at the bottom. Laurie decided not to finish the ascent to 515
m, but I couldn't resist and scurried up to the top, chasing some of the
eagles which give this mountain its name. The clouds came in quickly and
I became quite disoriented at the peak, but eventually found my way back
to Laurie and we returned to the car. After finishing our scenic loop around
the end of the Dingle Peninsula, we had a long drive up to our next destination.

<P>When we arrived in Kilfenora, very overdue at 9:30 PM, we were both
ready for bed. Our cheerful hostess, however, informed us that the Kilfenora
Ceili Band was releasing its new album that night with an infrequent free
ceili in the Kilfenora village hall. The Kilfenora Ceili Band has won the
All-Ireland Ceili Band Championships for the last 3 years running and is
normally far too busy travelling the world to return to Kilfenora. We couldn't
miss this and were treated to some marvellous set dancing from the locals,
