When he lived in Czechoslovakia, my grandfather had a good friend
whose son and wife now live in Prague.  The Green clan has been
continuing this friendship to the next generation: my cousin and
sister visited two years ago and my aunt and uncle just before that.
We went there for dinner and had a wonderful evening.  Although only
Hana spoke english, Lubos could understand enough to follow the
conversation.  The most interesting food of our trip was that evening:
blueberry filled dumplings with blueberry yogurt on top -- sweet and
heavy and DELICIOUS!  Hana then took us on a late night tour of
Prague, along the river and up behind/above the castle.

<p>We met Hana on <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/23full.jpg">Wenceslas Square<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a>, just in front of the National
Museum of the Czech republic, under the <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/22full.jpg">statue of
Wenceslas<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> himself.  The
long square (more like a wide avenue with grass boulevard) slopes down
away from the Museum towards the middle of town.  It was awesome to
stand at the top look down and imagine the whole square full of people
as it was during the recent revolution.
