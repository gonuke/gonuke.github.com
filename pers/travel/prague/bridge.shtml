One of the most famous attractions of Prague is the Charles Bridge.
On a nice day, you can spend nearly the whole day on this bridge,
listening the to the street performers (such as the Klezmer type
musicians to the right), browsing the artisans tables, and watching
the people stream back and forth.
<p>

The <a href="bridge2.shtml">bridge itself</a> is lined with statues,
has an arch at both ends, and offers some wondeful view back towards
the banks.  Throughout Prague you can find beautiful black and white
photographs of a quiet version of Charles Bridge full of nothing but
fog.  In these photos (which you will never be able to take yourself
thanks to all the people!) the statues loom magnificently up out of
the fog and the bridge takes on an entirely different character.

west side of the river, I would encourage you to go down below the
bridge where there is an entire neighborhood which appears to be less
crowded by tourists than some of the other places in Prague.
