<h1>The Jewish Museum of Prague</h1>

<p>Finally, before leaving on Sunday morning, we toured the Jewish
Museum, distributed amongst 4 old synagogues and the cemetery in the
old Jewish neighborhood.  One site (The Klaus Synagogue) is about
Judaism itself, describing various aspects of the religion using
various antiques from the Prague neighborhoods while another site (The
Maisel Synagogue) describes the history of the Jewish people in the
Czech Republic, and more specifically, within Prague.  These, however,
are not the most interesting parts!  The Pinkas Synagogue has been
emptied completely and the walls have been painted with the names of
every single Czech Jewish person who went missing during the Second
World War.  Ordered first by the last known town of residence and then
by last name, both floors of the synagogue nearly full (the top floor
has room for any that have, for whatever reason, been missed).
Unfortunately, I did not know enough about the my grandfather's first
family, whose names must certainly be there, to find them in the
lists.  The Old Cemetery is a tightly packed collection of
gravestones, not much bigger than most people's backyards.  The
graveyard is so small and packed that it looks like a forest of
stones.  Finally, the &quot;Old-New Synagogue&quot; is the oldest of all the
synagogues and was obviously intended only for the men: not only it is
very small, with a single row of seats around the outside, there is
absolutely no gallery, room, or separated area for women.
