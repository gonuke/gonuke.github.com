<h1>Selma &amp; Chaim in Prague</h1>

Our primary motivation for visiting Prague when we did was to see
Selma &amp; Chaim, Laurie's great aunt and uncle.  Although they were
in good spirits when we arrived and seem to have enjoyed their trip as
much as we enjoyed ours, I would not advise anyone to see Prague the
way they did.

<p>A few days before we arrived, Chaim had fallen in the shower and
broken 4 ribs.  He was in severe discomfort and not sleeping well.  As
we learned more about this, <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/34.jpg">Selma</a> was rushing
around getting us food for breakfast and boiling water for coffee and
tea.  The next thing we knew, she had slipped in the kitchen with a
pot of boiling water in hand.  The water went all over her foot, leg
and arm resulting in second degree burns!

<p>Selma and Chaim had needed only their first 3 days to become
excellent tour guides.  Every single suggestion they had was a hit,
whether it was a restaurant for dinner, a neighborhood to explore, or
an activity for the evening.
