In the middle of Venice, on Piazza San Marco, is the Doge's Palace.
The Doge's of Venice were a long line of people chosen to rule Venice
and surrounding areas.  While it was not quite democracy, it also
wasn't a hereditary system.  To make our visit more worthwhile, we
rented little audio-guides (you key in the number of each room as you
arrive and it tells you about what you see).  The picture at the left
is the view from a boat on the way to Lido.
