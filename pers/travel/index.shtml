   One of our most favourite hobbies is to travel to new countries and
   cities and explore. When we lived in Germany, we were able to
   pursue this hobby with new vigour. In addition to our new
   experiences in Germany itself, we have visited a number of
   different European countries, from Spain to Austria, Ireland to
   Italy. In some of these places, we have been lucky enough to have
   our own personal tour guides, friends which we have met elsewhere
   and are reunited with in their home town. In most of these places,
   we get a very special taste of the culture directly through a
   sampling of the food.<p>

   These pages are the on-line version of the travelogues which I
   began writing to send electronically to my family and
   friends. Unfortunately, I started writing them before I decided to
   put them on-line, so I don't have originals of them all. If you see
   a destination below without a travelogue, and you are lucky enough
   to have a copy, please send it back to me! <p>

    After many years, we spend a weekend together with old friends - my Best Men and their families - near Donner
    Lake, a slightly quieter location not far from Lake Tahoe.</td>

    <td width="50%"><b><a HREF="prague/index.shtml">Prague, <i>October 23-26, 1997</i></a></b> <br>
    A long weekend in the magical city of Prague was packed full of many interesting things
    and exciting adventures. Whether exploring the various neighborhoods, taking in the
    nightlife, or spending an evening with a local family, we enjoyed everything that the city
    had to offer.</td>

    Perhaps the most romantic city we have ever visited, we managed a few days of sightseeing
    in Venice before the day-long celebration of our friends' wedding. </td>

    <td><b><a HREF="ireland/index.shtml">Ireland, <i>August 1-18, 1997</i></a></b> <br>
    During this tour through much of Ireland, we experienced a wide range of what the green
    island had to offer. The friendliness of the people lived up to its reputation and the
    lush green hills were breathtaking, despite the wide range of weather.</td>

    During a short visit to Florence we also got to enjoy Sienna and Pisa. The highlight was a
    walk in the nearby hills to Fiesole and all the fabulous Italian food.</td>
