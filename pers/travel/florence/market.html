<h1>The Market in Florence</h1>
<hr>

For breakfast and lunch, we would often just drop in at the large
market in the middle of the city and buy all kinds of different
italian cheese, mixed vegetables, bread, and fresh produce.  We would
then take our little picnic to various places, whether it was on the
wall in <a href="siena.html">Siena</a> or a park near the hotel, and
enjoy magic of both the food and the location.  <p>
