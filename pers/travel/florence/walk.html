<hr>

By chance we found an advertisement for a company called &quot;<a href="http://www.ibikeitaly.com">I Bike Italy</a>&quot;.  They offer single
day bike tours in the hills around Florence, similar to what I will
describe below.  For various reasons, we were unable to do the bike
ride, so we took advantage of &quot;I Bike Italy's&quot; one day walk.  <p>

The weather was glorious and the day could not have been better.
Through meadows, olive groves, and the hills which were made famous in
the movie &quot;A Room with a View&quot;.  Many of the interior scenes were shot
in a villa which we passed near enough to touch.  We saw an old castle
from the middle ages and <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/florence/15full.jpg">one from a little more
recently<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a>, made by an
Englishman that liked the area, bought a huge chunk of land, built a
little villa and then planted thousands of trees all over the place.
It was a glorious day, and we passed through many beautiful flowery
fields, along quiet country paths, and past <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/florence/20full.jpg">small
houses with lush gardens<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a>.
We walked to a wonderful little <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/florence/18full.jpg">family run
restaurant<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> and had a
great special meal of gorgonzola filled ravioli and tagliatelli in a
special vegetable sauce.  All this was preceeded by crostini, small
pieces of bread with amazing pate's, both a vegetarian and a meat one.
<p>


After lunch we visited a <a href="vineyard.html">small vineyard<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> which makes a few hundred
bottles a year for specialty and local consumption.  I don't think
they retail any of their wine other than to those who visit the
vineyard itself. We had a little tour of all their facilities
including the huge vats full of 1995's vintage waiting another year or
so before bottling.  We learned all about how Chianti is made (the
correct mix of grapes and the right waiting period to let it ferment
enough).  During our walk, we learned what makes the olive oil from
Tuscany so special (and expensive).  First, all the trees are picked
by hand.  This does not simply mean that people still do it instead of
machines.  This means that a person climbs into the tree and hand
picks every single olive which goes into the oil!  One of the reasons
for this is to pick the olives before they are completely ripe which
gives the oil a little bite.  The oil is then cold pressed and
bottled, all the leftovers sold to those people who make all the cheap
stuff.  This vineyard also has a little olive grove from which they
make their own olive oil.  We got to taste some as it was being hand
bottled.  We finished our visit with a little purchase of two bottles
of Chianti and one of olive oil (the oil costs about 2.5 times what
the wine costs!!).  <p>

The day was topped off with Laurie's purchase of a new purse, with a
little bartering help from an American on the trip with us.  On our
last day, we met a couple who had met another couple (I know this
sounds like the introduction to an urban legend but it isn't) who were
enjoying their copy of a book called &quot;Walking and Eating in Tuscany
and Umbria&quot; or something like that.  After our day away from the
crowds and sights in the countryside, I would recommend that everyone
who visits Florence get a copy!
