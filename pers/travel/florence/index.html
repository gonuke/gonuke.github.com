Florence and Tuscany,<br>
<i>May 3-8, 1997</i></H1>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Laurie and I spent a week at the beginning of May in Florence and
environs.  There are four ways to divide our activities while
there: sights of Florence, day trips in Tuscany, food! and hiking in
the hills near Florence.  One could probably spend five days on
each of these things, if not more.  We managed to squeeze a
sampling of each in during the five days we had.  We visited a
host of churches and a couple of major galleries, spent some time in
Siena and Pisa, ate fabulous Italian food everywhere we went, and had
a wonderful day under the sun in the countryside.

Although we didn't see all of the many interesting churches,
cathedrals and galleries, we managed to get a good sample!

<h3><a href="area.html">Day Trips in Tuscany</a></h3>

We made two short trips to Pisa and Siena, local cities with their own
charm, sights and character.

<h3><a href="food.html">Not Just Another <i>Olive Garden</i></a></h3>

Laurie and I could never get our fill of Italian food, even with
eating nothing else for 5 days!

<h3><a href="walk.html">We Walked Italy</a></h3>

The absolute highlight of the trip was a hike from just outside Florence
up to the ancient (pre-Roman) city of Fiesole.

<P>That about wraps up our Florence visit.  Laurie and I had a great
time.  We didn't see and do everything, but who knows, we may go back. 
I hope you enjoyed hearing about it.
