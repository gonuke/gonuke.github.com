Laurie and I finished the year with a wonderful trek of France and
Spain.  We spent a few days over Christmas visiting Maxime, Magali and
Samuel (French friends from Madison) in Pierrevert (near
Aix-en-Provence), a few days between Christmas and New Years visiting
with Jennifer at Joan's near Barcelona (and throughout Catalu&ntilde;a), and
then an amazing few days in Madrid and environs over New Years with Sama
(a Spanish friend from Madison).  This was topped off with a few more
days in France in Bordeaux.
<p>

<h3>Provence</h3>
You may remember our Easter visit to Provence.  We visited the same
people, but this time in Maxime and Magali's new house.  It is a cute
bungalow (4 rooms, living room, dining room and nice sized kitchen) with
a huge backyard and lots of trees.  We begun our holiday in fine form
with real relaxation.  On Christmas Eve, Maxime's parents (you may
remember that they gave us their own bed at Easter) and Magali's sister,
Helene, arrived.  We enjoyed a light and simple Christmas Eve Dinner,
joined by Tom Gianakon of UW-Madison/Nucleons Softball fame.  On
Christmas day, we had a fish lunch with, of course, lots of cheeses. 
Our particular favourites were the various chevres (Goat Cheeses).
<p>

The weather was cooperative: cool but rain free.  Laurie and I went for
a few walks, with and without others: through a national forest near
Manosque, up to the village for some flowers, around a field in
Pierrevert, and, most importantly, on our house-hunting trek.  We found
a beautiful property built on a hill with an unobstructed view of
Manosque in the near distance and the French Alps on the horizon.  Not
only was it a large two story house, but it has a pool beside it, on a
patio which also looks out over the valley.  From our view from the
road, the pool looked like it disappeared over a waterfall (which it did
sort of, into a little fountain).  It was picture perfect -- the owners
didn't appear to be selling, but we have a couple of years to convince
them :) :)
<p>

<h3>Barcelona</h3>
We arrived in Barcelona on Boxing Day (that's the 26th for those
Americans out there) in the early evening (9:00 PM) and returned to
Joan's parents' in Olesa de Montserrat for dinner.  We were happy to
have relaxed in Pierrevert because our pace in Barcelona was somewhat
more hectic.  The first day began at about noon and we visited Barcelona
itself, seeing the Gothic quarter, many of the cathedrals, and buying a
couple of pairs of shoes for Jennifer on the way.  We quickly settled
into the Spanish meal schedule: lunch began at 2:30 PM and finished at
about 4.  We met Joan again at 6:30 (he worked that day) and wandered
around some more before our dinner starting at 9 PM (rather early for
your average Spaniard!)  We had an interesting dinner tasting many
little things (you may sense, after a while, that all we did on our trip
was eat... you wouldn't be too far off!) like squid, more cheeses,
various sausages, more squid, fish pate's, etc.
<p>

The next day was a trek through Catalu&ntilde;a.  We met Quim and Christina
just North of Barcelona and Quim pulled a "Voyage through Time" out of
his sleeve.  We stopped first at the ruins of an old Iberian community. 
This community thrived during the same period as the Roman Empire, and
there were many interesting artifacts as well as some ruins of the
buildings themselves.  The next stop was a walled medieval village that
we explored and in which we stopped for a quick snack lunch. 
Unfortunately, because of diminishing light, we had to skip a couple of
stops on our tour: an old Greek fishing village and a protected
wetlands, so that we could make it to Cap de Creus before dark.  Cap de
Creus is the eastern most part of the Iberian peninsula and was
magnificent, despite the extreme wind.  At the end of the cape, there is
a precipice from which you can look out over the Meditteranean.  We tool
a short look into the dusk and escaped quickly from the cold wind to the
pub (rather remote, but convenient for the lighthouse keeper) for some
hot chocolates.  To blow some time we wandered around the tourist
village of Cadaques surrounded by children celebrating the 28th of
December (the Spanish April Fools' Day) sticking things on our backs. 
We went to turn on the heat at the summer apartment we would be sleeping
at (it didn't help much) and then went for dinner in an "exclusive
restaurant".  This restaurant seated people by reservation only, even if
it was empty -- if you didn't make a reservation at least 24 hours in
advance, you didn't get to eat.  We were the only people in the whole
place as we enjoyed our traditional Catalan meal of crayfish and chicken
in a spicy sauce, eaten with our fingers.  That night was, shall we say,
chilly as the apartment was not insulated for winter and had no heating
save the small and ineffectual space heaters.  Luckily we had lots of
blankets!
<p>

We began our next day at an old monastery (perhaps also a pre-Christian
religious site) in the snow!  It was a couple of hundred metres above
the sea, but snowy nonetheless.  After a quick tour, it was off to beat
the weather back to Barcelona, with a stop in the Salvidor Dali museum. 
This place is a real work of art! (HA HA)  Before he died, Dali designed
it himself on the site of the old Municipal Theatre, across the street
from the church in which he was baptised, and in which he had his first
exposition.  It was really cramped, and extremely weird.  What did I
think of it?  Let's just say that I used to like Dali.  In my entirely
non-expert (anti-expert??) opinion, the famous paintings which all have
seen, with the drooping clocks, etc, are the best things.  The rest of
it is just kind of messy!  But, as I said, I am hardly an expert.  Many
of the sculptures and scenes (Dali arranged entire rooms with paintings,
sculpture, and other art forms as entire pieces of art) looked to be
weird for the sake of being weird.  When we arrived back in Barcelona,
we walked along the beach from the Olympic port to the Harbour enjoying
the surf, the sunset, and the sand.  Then, once we carefully planned our
return to the train station (we didn't want to miss the night train to
Madrid) we relaxed with a "tapas" dinner.

<h3>Madrid</h3>
Our night trip to Madrid was less successful that our first one -- the
compartment door wouldn't stay closed and the train was noisy.  I also
don't fit too well into those bunks!  We arrived at about 7:30 AM and
Sama had managed to have a few hours sleep after her partying before
meeting us at the station.  We had an early breakfast as soon as we
arrived, went back to Sama's place to "freshen up", and began our
busiest day.  We walked all over Madrid!  We were on our feet for 6 1/2
hours over all, and walked here and there, back here, over there, a
little further that way, and then over there.  We saw most of the
important sites of Madrid, although the museums were closed on Mondays
(and guess what day we were there) and the line up for the Palace was
huge.  There is a cool cathedral (at least construction wise -- yeah I'm
an engineering geek) which was opened just 7 years ago and built on top
of an old cathedral.  We saw the cathedral from the outside and it
looked huge, with a cupola and many floors.  We went in, however, and
found a low ceiling and a small cathedral.  We were thoroughly confused
until we walked up the hill to the "back" and found the new cathedral. 
We met Sama's brother, Roberto, (really her best friend for about 20
years) for lunch at 2:30 and started lunch at about 3:30.  When done at
about 5 we continued our exploration of Madrid through a nice big
park/garden and to Columbus Square.  We then wove our way through most
of the streets in central Madrid in our search for the car and had a
quick visit of an Egyptian temple, transported to Madrid as a gift from
the Egyptian government when it was endangered by the construction of a
dam in Egypt.  Our dinner started late (as usual -- 10 PM) in the
restaurant where Sama's sister works.  We all shared a lot of appetizers
(ravioli, octopus, warm chevre, and mango with blue cheese ---MMMMM!)
and enjoyed ourselves until about midnight.  There were some apparently
famous Spanish celebrities there, but I wouldn't have recognized them :)
<p>

We awoke and left by 9 the next day to visit Toledo, famous for the
remnants of its "Golden Age" of peaceful coexistence between Jews,
Muslims and Christians before the Spanish Inquisition.  I won't get to
bore you with the details of Toledo however, because we were diverted by
a not so small blizzard.  About 10 km out of Madrid the snow began to
fall and fall and fall and fall.  In no time, the windshield was caked
with snow and ice despite the best efforts of the wipers, the road was
covered with snow.  Although these things seem extreme to Spaniards
unaccustomed to snow, my Canadian opinion was that it was truly a severe
blizzard.  Not knowing how long our drive would be through 20 cm of snow
on unplowed roads, we made the executive decision to abort Toledo and
head directly for the country house near Talavera.  After about an hour
of slow going (only about 15 km) we found ourselves on a main road and
had an easier trip.  The advantage was that we had a few hours for
Laurie to nap and recharge for the New Year's party to come...
<p>

Notice I said New Year's party, and not New Year's Eve party!  We began
dinner as a family (plus us as visitors of course) at 10 or 10:30 PM. 
We ate until shortly before midnight when we turned on the TV to watch
the clock at Plaza del Sol in Madrid strike 12.  Following the Spanish
tradition, we ate one grape for each chime of the clock, as it chimed. 
With my monstrous mouth, I had little problem, but Laurie wasn't quite so
successful.  Then we all had time to shower and change before the party
began at about 1 AM.  Hence the New Year's party -- contrary to my
experiences in N. America, the Spanish celebrate the New Year, not the
end of the previous one.  We partied until 7 in the morning, when Laurie
and I fell into bed, not the first, but also not the last.  I wanted to
stay up until 8 to wish my parents Happy New Year in Edmonton, but we
couldn't make it.  We danced and drank and partied constantly at Sama's
place with all the friends she grew up with, speaking occasional
English.  It was one of the best New Year's that I remember.
<p>

The next day was very slow and relaxing after everyone (including Sama's
parents) had been up until the late morning.  We had a big lunch and
slowly cleaned up after the night before and left in time to catch our
night train from Madrid to Bordeaux.

<h3>Bordeaux</h3>
Laurie and I finished our trip in Bordeaux with a day and a half of city
visiting.  We wandered the pedestrian streets and parks of Bordeaux the
afternoon we arrived and spent the next day visiting everything that was
art in Bordeaux: the Museum of Fine Arts (more historical), the Museum
of Contemporary Art and Architecture, and the Museum of Decorative Art
(real objects and art from old families in the Bordeaux region).  In
comparison to the other places, it seems kind of boring, but it was
really interesting.  Laurie also managed to pick up a cheap pair of
dressy pants.
<p>

Our departure from Bordeaux was the most eventful.  It seems that on the
4th, the day we planned to leave at 8:30, Bordeaux was the center of all
bad weather in France.  The main problem, besides the -20C temperatures,
was the freezing rain which prevented all electric trains from running. 
Therefore, instead of a 3 hour TGV (high speed train -- electric of
course) ride to Paris starting at 8:30, we had a 5 1/2 hour ride
starting at 10:30.  Luckily, we were still able to find a reasonable
connection back to Karlsruhe, and were only about 3 hours late in end!

<h3>Return to Home</h3>
Arriving back in Germany to an empty fridge on Saturday the 4th is a
really bad idea!  Everything is closed on Sundays and the 6th is a
holiday -- everything closed again.
