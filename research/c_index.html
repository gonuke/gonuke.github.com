   <h2><li> Deterministic Inventory Analysis: <a href=http://alara.engr.wisc.edu>ALARA</a></h2>

   The <i>Analytic &amp; Laplacian Adaptive Radioactivity Analysis</i>
   code project began as an effort to improve on the physical and
   mathematical modeling capabilities of fusion activation codes.
   Ongoing development of ALARA includes the addition of new user
   features as well as continuous evaluation of new modeling methods.

   <h2><li> <a href=MCInv>Stochastic Inventory Analysis</a></h2>

   Recently funded by a <a href=http://neer.ne.doe.gov>NEER</a> grant,
   this project will explore a whole new class of methods for
   simulating the isotopic inventories of all materials in a nuclear
   system.  A need to model increasingly complex flows of materials
   and irradiation histories motivates a search of an analog to the
   relatively well-understood Monte Carlo techniques for radiation
   transport.

   <span id=highlight>Surface Modifcation of Materials for Supercritical Water Environments.</span><br>
   A <a href=http://neri.ne.doe.gov>NERI</a> funded project at the
   UW-Madison is focusing on the search for the best cladding
   materials in a super-critical light water reactor.  Following the
   construction of a natural circulation super-critical water loop,
   corrosion tests will be performed on samples of materials that have
   been modified by plasma source ion implantation.  My interests lie
   in the supporting task of performing reactor physics/core design
   calculations to demonstrate the neutronic behaviour of the
   candidate cladding materials.

   <span id=highlight>Neutron-induced Radiolysis in Supercritical Water</span><br>

   In support of a <a href=http://neri.ne.doe.gov>NERI</a> funded
   project at Argonne National Laboratory,a small volume flow loop for
   supercritical water will be built for insertion into one of the
   UWNR beam ports.  With the appropriate chemical analysis
   techniques, the rates of radiolysis in the supercritical water due
   to neutrons from the reactor core will be inferred.  My interests
   are based in the neutronics design of the experiment and the
   modeling of the UWNR.

   <span id=highlight>Conceptual Development of Mixed Spectrum Supercritical Water Reactor</span><br>

   The low density of supercritical water results in a lack of
   moderation in the supercritical region of the core.  While most
   concepts propose a variety of dedicated moderators, one alternative
   is to operate different regios of the reactor with different
   spectra: a thermal spectrum in the subcritical portion and a fast
   spectrum in the supercritical portion.  We are currently
   investigating reactor phsyics aspects of a such a reactor arranged
   in an annular fashion.
   

   <h2><li> Nuclear Fuel Cycle Transparency</h2>

   Most realistic scenarios for future global energy supply include an
   expansion of nuclear power deployment.  For this to occur without
   increasing tension and concern in the global community vis-a-vis
   proliferation risks, a sufficient level of <i>transparency</i> must
   be built into the nuclear fuel cycle - the global community must be
   confident that any attempt at material diversion will be difficult
   to conceal.  Work in collaboration with Sandia National
   Laboratories will begin exploring this issue.
   
   <h2><li> UWNR Modeling and Simulation</h2>

   The U. Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor offers an increasingly rare
   resource of neutrons for a variety of experimental opportunities.
   In order to facilitate the development of new experiments using the
   reactor, it will be important to be able to model the neutron
   spectra at various existing and future irradiation positions.
   Current efforts are focused on validating MCNP<sup>TM</sup> models
   for the UWNR by comparison to irradiation experiments in the
   reactor beam ports.
