<b>ALARA</b> takes full advantage of being a newly developed code by
implementing the best features of the previous generation of
activation codes and, at the same time, addressing their various
weaknesses.  Furthermore, an entirely new set of features has been
implemented and continued development will allow it to respond to the
evolving needs of the entire user community.  <b>ALARA</b>'s three main
design principles are accuracy, speed, and usability.  <b>ALARA</b> matches
the previous generation of activation codes in accuracy and is much
faster.  This is achieved by adaptively choosing the mathematical
method at the smallest resolution in order to optimize both speed and
accuracy.
<p>

ALARA distinguishes itself by including unique capabilities that are useful to engineers and designers:
<ul>
  <li> unlimited number of reaction channels
  <li> exact modeling of hierarchical arbitrary irradiation schedules
  <li> reverse calculation mode
</ul>
<p>

ALARA implements many of the standard features of activation codes including:
<ul>
  <li> multi-point (3-D) solutions in a variety of geometries
  <li> accurate solution of loops in activation trees
  <li> exact modeling of multi-level pulsing irradiation histories
  <li> user-defined calculation precision/accuracy
  <li> tracking the accumulation of light ions
  <li> straightforward, user-friendly input file creation
  <li> full, easy-to-read activation tree output (not just pathway analysis)
  <li> flexible output options NOW including the direct calculation of waste disposal ratings and clearance indices.
</ul> 


Finally, <b>ALARA</b> is undergoing continuous development with many
<a href=comingsoon.shtml>new features</a> planned for implementation,
both to increase the level of physical modeling, the range of problems
which can be solved, and its ease of use.  <b>ALARA</b> is a fully
developed and validated alternative to the previous generation of
activation codes.
