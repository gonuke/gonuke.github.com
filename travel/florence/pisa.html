	 Believe it or not, people actually go to school here.  In
	 fact, the woman who guided us back to the right side of town
	 after we got lost is studying in just such a building.

	 On the right here you can see that famous tower of Pisa.
	 Although it almost seems upright here, remember that the
	 cathedral does NOT lean!

	 Not quite as well known as the tower, the cathedral and

	 tower.
