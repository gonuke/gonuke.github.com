<p>What trip to Italy would be complete without tons and tons of
delicious Italian food.  I won't go into all the details because we
had far too much delicious food and most people have a good idea what
Italian food is all about.  Just imagine really good Italian food, and
then imagine it every meal for 6 days, but 10 times better.  Laurie
arrived convinced that Gelato was just watered down ice cream and left
a true convert.  We had as much as we could get our hands on without
gaining 20 pounds each and going broke (it is not cheap!).

The best meal was, like all the other place we have visited, a
home-cooked one.  Purely by coincidence (there was an oil crisis at
his place in Karlsruhe - olive oil of course!), one of my colleagues
was home for the weekend in -- you guessed it -- Florence.  We went to
his mother's for lunch and it was amazing.  After a little bit of
prosecco (champagne) the first course was an artichoke lasagne!  Wow!
This was followed by a Tuscan favourite, tomatoes with mozarella and
basil.  For dessert -- Gelato!  Lorenzo's mother was a really sweet
woman.  She spoke good English, particularly for someone who has lived
all their life in Florence, and better than Lorenzo.  We spent nearly
an hour after lunch going through all her books (and she has many)
about the various churches of Florence.  She is also very active,
currently in the middle of becoming an actress for the first time.
Someone has written a play specifically for her group of 11 or so
retired women (The Inner Wheel - related to The Rotary Club) so that
no-one would be offended by not having a starring role.  They rehearse
nearly daily as their recital date at the end of the month approaches!
