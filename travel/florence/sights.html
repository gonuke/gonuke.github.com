<hr WIDTH="100%"> <br>We spent the equivalent of a few days exploring
the varied and famous sights of Florence.  As with most other places
in Italy, there is a church around every corner.  In this case there
are many fabulous and elaborate churches in addition to the Duomo
(cathedral) which is an unmissable landmark in the middle of the city.
My favourite, and the first that we visited is the Basilica Santa
Croce.  It is completely full with tombs and monuments to a long list
of famous people from the Renaissance on.  In the classical realm, you
can find Dante (this author of the Divine Comedy is a favourite
celebrity of Florence), Ghiberti (most well known for his brass
bas-relief doors on <a href="baptistry.html"><img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/florence/4.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="293">the Duomo's Baptistry</a>), Machiavelli (whose ideas of
ruling and governing were revolutionary in his book The Price),
Rossini (who wrote the Barber of Seville - see Bugs Bunny) and one of
Florence's favourite sons, Michelangelo.  In the realm of science, the
list begins with Galileo and ends with a personal favourite, Enrico
Firmi, the designer of the very first man-made nuclear reactor.  There
was also a monument to Marcone, the inventor of wireless radio.  Of
course, other than all the dead people who are celebrated there, the
church itself is a magnificent piece of architecture filled with
marvelous frescoes and stained glass.

<p>On the theme of Churches, there is also a magnificent <a href="synagogue.html">Synagogue in Florence<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a>, although it is only about 150 years
old.  It was built when the emancipation of the Jews of Florence was
combined with the coincidental death of one of their richest who lef
all his money for the construction of the building.  It was is a
monumental building which makes its mark on the skyline of Florence,
equalling most of the best churches.  Although it is fairly recent
built, it was intentionally designed to reflect the origins of the
Jewish population in Florence.  In addition to the various traditional
styles of the Jews from Spain and Portugal, the most noticable feature
is the <a href="moorish.html">unending decoration of the walls<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> following a moorish
superstition that empty spaces would bring bad luck.

<p>The discussion of churches would not be complete without <a href="duomo.html">the Duomo of Florence<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a>.  This building completely dominates the city with its
size and location.  Directly in the middle of Florence this
garganutuan cathedral is absolutely full of dead people!  Nearly every
square inch of the floor is covered with some kind of tombstone for
some person whose name I didn't recognize.  The dome of the cathedral
is the highest feature of Florence and you can climb up the inside of
it get a good view of Florence.  We didn't spend a lot of time here,
however, because of all the other tourists - more on that later.

<p><a href="david.html"><img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/florence/5.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="288"></a>Another major feature of Florence, not to be missed,
is the Galleria dell' Accademia.  This is none other than the home of
Michelanglo's David in full glory.  David is the true centerpoint of
this gallery at the end of the first and main hallway in a small dome
all to himself.  Other attractions of the Accademia are many plaster
models from some of the old professors of the accademy used before
making marble final statues and more &quot;Adoration of Christ&quot;s,
&quot;Annunciation&quot;s and &quot;Martyrdom of Saint ....&quot;s than you can shake a
stick at!  The best thing about all these paintings on a similar theme
is that they have very interesting and informative explanations which
help explain a lot about the history of the area and the history of
art in the Renaissance.

<p>The other important gallery is perhaps the most famous: the Uffizi.
This magnificent art gallery was bombed in 1993 by the Mafia in an
attempt to slow down the government prossecutions.  Unfortunately they
are still recovering, at least in part, from this explosion which
destroyed much of the west wing of the gallery which houses the most
recent works.  According to one of my colleagues, when he was there a
couple of year ago, they had moved most of the paintings from this
wing to the other wing so that they could be seen.  I think they must
have finished the renovations and were in the process of returning
them all to their original places, hence the closings.  My favourite
part of this gallery was the Botticelli room where I was a stowaway on
a very long, informative description of Bottecelli's &quot;Allegory of
Spring&quot;.  Most of you have probably seen this painting somewhere in a
book, on a greeting card, or the like.  The provider of all this great
information was an art history student from Dartmouth who spoke for
well over 45 minutes about all the imagery, history and important
artistic aspects of this painting.  <p>

Not all the sights of Florence are buildings or their contents.  <a href="boboli.html">The Gardens of Boboli<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> are a wonderful place to spend a
morning, an afternoon, or even a whole day.  At the top of the
gardens, in addition to a small porcelain museum and Fort Belvedere,
there is a wonderful view back towards the center of the city.  There
are also a <a href="other.sights.html">few little things<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> hidden around the city which are
best found by accident.
