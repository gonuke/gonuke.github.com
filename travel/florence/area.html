Trips in Tuscany</h1>

<hr>

<p>We made two small journeys to other cities in Tuscany.  Most of
a day in Siena and a few hours in Pisa.
<p>

<a href="siena.html">Siena<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> has a lot of character with many ups and downs as it is
built on many hills.  It is also has a huge Duomo.  In the middle of
town is the large Piazza del Campo, home of the twice annual Palio di
Siena is marked by a bareback horse race around the Piazza.  We went
up the tower in the middle of the square (400 steps) and had a
marevelous view of Siena and surrounds as the clouds rolled in.
Laurie was also intrigued by many of the <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/florence/doors.jpg">doorways
in Siena</a>.<p>

As we were warned by most Italians who have been there (including one
who lived there for many years going to university) that one doesn't
need much time for <a href="pisa.html">Pisa<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a>.  Had we not gotten ourselves lost
(how is that possible our Italian friends say!) they would have been
right.  There really is little to see there!  You can't go up the
tower anymore because it really does lean a lot.  Since they can't
earn money from that anymore, they charge for access to the cathedral
and baptistry, but we had seen so many already that we just took
pictures from the outside.
