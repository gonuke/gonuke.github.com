<h1>Travelogue Venice: September 11-14, 1997</h1>

Despite Laurie having a terrible cold and only having 2 days to
ourselves, we loved the city of Venice.  We went to Venice in
mid-September for only a few days to help our friends celebrate their
wedding.  We travelled there overnight arriving on Thursday morning
and left on Sunday morning to enjoy a winding train ride through the
Dolomites and the Brenner Pass on the way home.
<p>

Our first day was not very successful since the hotel was not ready
for us so early in the morning.  This was not a big surprise, but it
did become frustrating when they kept telling us to come back in an
hour.  We desparately wanted to have a shower before starting our day,
but would have gladly done without had they simply told us at the
beginning that it would be 3 hours before we could get our room.  We
did stroll around and explore the area near the hotel.

The major sight which we saw in Venice was the <a href="palace.shtml">Doge's Palace</a>, but the magic of Venice is its
romance.  As cliché as it may sound, the romantic mood is
really set by <a href="gondolas.shtml">the gondolas</a>, the canals, <a href="rialto.shtml">the bridges</a>, and the many well-lit side streets
which make for romantic evening strolls.  We also spent an afternoon
exploring Murano, the home of Venetian glass, and bought ourselves
some crystal!
