<h1>The Streets of Prague</h1>

Being such an old and regal city, Prague is full of winding streets
with various architectures and hidden squares around every corner.  As
a result, Laurie and I spent much of our time exploring Prague in this
way.
<p>

Not only were the <a href="facades.shtml">various facades<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a> themselves brightly painted and
ornate, but many had <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/27afull.jpg">painted in-lays</a>, <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/27bfull.jpg">bas-relief panels</a> and specially carved <a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/28full.jpg">window frames</a>.  <p>

<a href="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/33full.jpg"><img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/prague/33.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="216"></a> The
juxtaposition of the new and old architecture can be seen in the photo
at the left.  The gilded roof of an old concert house (I think) is
seen in the reflection on a modern glass-fronted building.

<p> To top it all off, in addition to the normal statues and monuments
that you find in any old city, there are <a href="statues.shtml">statues built into many of the buildings<img alt src="/~wilsonp/images/graphics/photoicon.gif" border="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></a>.
