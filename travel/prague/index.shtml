A visit to Prague by Laurie's great uncle and aunt was all the excuse
we needed to spend a long weekend there.  Selma and Chaim spent two
weeks there, in the middle of which we visited for 3 or 4 days.

<P>It ended up being a busy weekend full of adventure, interesting people
and intriguing places.  There is never enough time in 2 1/2 days to
visit any city properly, and that is particularly true of Prague. 
There are many things we missed, either because we didn't have the time
or the weather didn't cooperate.  We hope to go back someday!

<P>Although we have often taken overnight trains to reach our
destinations, we went one step further and travelled to Prague in a
sleeper car, rather than a simple couchette.  It made such a big
difference not to have to share the compartment with any others and to
have a little private sink and mirror at our disposal.  It was well
worth the extra cost!  It meant that we arrived in Prague far more
refreshed than our previous overnight trips.  After eventually finding
the hotel - we had left the name and address hotel at home and spent
about one hour in the train station toiling with currency exchange and
phone card acquisition - we settled in to assess and contribute to <a
href="selma_chaim.shtml">Selma and Chaim's injuries</a>.

<P>Laurie and I enjoyed the magical city of Prague.  We spent a lot of
time <a href="streets.shtml">roaming around the streets</a> on both
sides of the river.  The winding irregular streets lined with a vast
array of architecture and gilded statues make it as easy to spend the
whole day exploring as it is to get lost.  Fortunately we did more of
the former!  We saw the astronomical clock in the <a
href="square.shtml">Old Town Square</a>, strolled around the old Jewish
neighborhood, crossed <a href="bridge.shtml">the Charles Bridge</a>,
and went up to <a href="castle.shtml">the Castle</a>.  While we didn't
make it to the Opera, we did spend one evening at a black light
theatre.  Although we enjoyed the show, we later discovered that it
was one of many copies of the original and apparently well known
"Laterna Magica".  If you go, I would suggest the original.  (It
didn't help that our rather "uncouth" fellow audience members refused
to understand either the requests not to take photos, or the idea that
taking photos completely ruined the effect for the entire audience!)
On Saturday night, we enjoyed an evening at home with some <a
href="hana.shtml">acquaintences in Prague.</a> Finally, before leaving
on Sunday morning, we toured the <a href="jew_museum.shtml">Jewish
Museum.</a>


<P>We spent much of the ride home sitting across from a freelance
photo-journalist of Norwegian origin.  He was very interesting with
all the stories and places he has seen (including having recently
finishing a 6 month tour working with UN Forces in the middle east).
One of the things I found the most interesting, however, was his age
-- or should I say his youth.  He was only about the same age as us,
or younger, something that seemed to me not to fit with a
photo-journalist who had travelled the world.  He got his start at the
Lillehammer Winter Olympics where he also managed to get a photo in
Time magazine.
