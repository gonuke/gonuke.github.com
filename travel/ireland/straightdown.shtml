<CENTER><P>This is a view over the edge of one of the cliffs along the
<A HREF="cliffsmoher.shtml">Cliffs of Moher</A>. As we arrived at this ledge,<BR>
just North of the nicely arranged official visitors area, there were two
German's dropping things over the<BR>
edge and watching them fall. The last of these was a large rock which happened
to be one of the<BR>
steps down to the ledge. To take this picture, I&nbsp;had to sit on Laurie's
legs because she was afraid that<BR>
the weight of her head might cause her whole body to go over the edge.</P></CENTER>
