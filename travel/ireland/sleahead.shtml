<P>The picturesque Slea Head Drive goes from Dingle Town around the end
of the Dingle Peninsula and returns to Dingle Town. On the south side of
this drive are low cliffs and steep shores. As it goes around the end of
the island, it nearly rings <A HREF="mteagle.shtml">Mt. Eagle</A>. Half
way between Dunquin and Ballyferriter, there is a large pottery studio.
When we were there, the work all showed an oriental influence. All the
work was also very practical, from full place settings to tea/coffee services,
matching lampshades, and a full range of accessory pieces. We were forced
to buy a large serving platter.</P>
