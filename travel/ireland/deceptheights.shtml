<CENTER><P>Here, at the summit (it is hardly a peak, let alone a summit)
of Damph, you can nearly see the top of Sleive Main<BR>
to the left and can clearly see the top of Sleive Snaught to the right.
The saddle betwen is roughly the same<BR>
altitude as the summit from where this photo was taken. One thing which
we learned a lot about during our<BR>
hikes was the deceptiveness of heights. In this case, to us, Sleive Snaught
did not look 200 m higher than we<BR>
were. It certainly didn't look as high as it felt once we climbed it!</P></CENTER>
