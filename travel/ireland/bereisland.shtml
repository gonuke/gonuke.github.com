<P>As you can see from the map below, Bere Island is quite a small island:&nbsp;roughly
8 km long and less than 4 km wide. We never reached what appeared from
the map to be the most populated part, the bay on the northeast side. Instead,
we followed a path from the northwest ferry crossing point, along the main
road to the east, turning to back the west at the junction between the
central and eastern peaks. We followed this road up to the top of the central
and highest peak, and then returned to the ferry crossing point on the
road between the central and western peaks.</P>

<P>While the island offered wonderful views, even on such an overcast day,
back to the mainland and there are many monuments on the island itself,
the island itself looks to be locked in a poor economic condition. We were
disturbed by number of abandoned and rusting vehicles strewn around the
island. I&nbsp;would guess that we saw roughly 15 different vehicles lying
in random fields on the 10 km or so route we walked.</P>
