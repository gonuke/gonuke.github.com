<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Search for Music in Ireland</H1>

<hr>


<P>One of the things that I&nbsp;searched for throughout Ireland was authentic
music. Having seen Riverdance in London at Christmas 1995, I&nbsp;was excited
about the prospect of finding a small, out-of-the-way pub in a small, out-of-the-way
village and hearing some real folk music being strummed, blown and beaten
out by the locals. I&nbsp;suppose this was a romantic notion...</P>

<P>In Mitchelstown, we expected to find the &quot;Mitchelstown International
Music Festival&quot;, promising lots of good music, small friendly stages
and good folky jamming. When it was cancelled and we were sent to Millstreet,
we were disappointed to see that it cost a small fortune to watch professionally
mixed big name bands on indoor and rain-soaked outdoor stages. Glengarrif
sported, amongs others, a French Country and Western singer. Granted, in
Kilfenora, we successfully attended the CD&nbsp;release Ceili for the Kilfenora
Ceili band, but Ceili music wasn't what I&nbsp;had in mind either. In Cleggan,
in a region known for its music, we searched high and low throughout all
the pubs only to find one in which some kind of electronic keyboards were
being set up.</P>

<P>In Dublin, when we finally found this &quot;Traditional Irish Music&quot;&nbsp;pub
crawl, I&nbsp;was sure that the quest would finally be fulfilled. It was
close! The two musicians which hosted our tour played interesting and beautiful
music. They talked a little bit about the development of Irish music, but
mostly about how they had learned the various songs from this and that
musician. The tour wasn't helped by the fact that there were one or two
obnoxious Canadians (no, not us!) who could not keep the beat, but insisted
on clapping to the music anyway. Again, I&nbsp;would recommend this tour
to anyone, but note that you will only hear the two guides, not a different
group in each pub as we thought from the flier.</P>
