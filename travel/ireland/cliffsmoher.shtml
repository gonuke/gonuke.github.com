<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Cliffs of Moher</H1>

<P>The visitors centre for these cliffs is just off the main road and has
parking for hundreds of visitors. This is one good reason to climb the
fence or stone wall and leave the &quot;official&quot;&nbsp;area to the
peace and quiet of the cliffs. This should not be done by the fainthearted,
however. As our book, &quot;<A HREF="bestirishwalks.shtml">The Best Irish
Walks</A>&quot;&nbsp;points out, &quot;Farm fences have been erected quite
close to the cliff edge, so that walking on a windy day is quite dangerous.&quot;
It does continue, &quot;But the cliffs are so wonderful that I&nbsp;do
not want to discourage you completely.&quot; With this I&nbsp;would agree.
</P>

<P>In addition to the requesite small museum and tea shop, the visitors
centre has a small tower erected directly on the cliff's edge long ago
by a philanthropic nobleman wishing to help all comers have a good view
of the cliffs. This has been supplemented today by the standard high-powered,
coin-operated binoculars that one has come to expect at such a site today.</P>

<P>If you look directly over the edge of the cliff (if you go North from
the visitors center, there is a large flat surface where <A HREF="straightdown.shtml">one
can lie down and do this</A>), the view is ominous, the ocean seaminly
miles away. Then, as one walks along the cliffs, the views of various rock
outcroppings nearly becoming islands, the birds flying around the rocks,
and finally, back along the cliffs are well worth the walk.</P>
