<P>We were greeted on Friday, August 1, by glorious sunny weather. Although
we arrived at roughly 1 PM, we didn't manage to leave Dublin airport until
nearly 2:30, and had our first experience with the high speed national
highway system of Ireland. Our first trip was roughly 100 km, but took
us about 2 1/2 hours. We arrived in time to check into our B&amp;B, explore
the village, find some dinner, and go to bed. The next day promised excitement:
we were on our way to the Mitchelstown International Music Festival. Stopping
at the Mitchelstown caves to explore beautiful calcite-coated caverns,
we went directly to Mitchelstown only to discover that the festival was
cancelled this year due to a lack of support by local pubs. We visited
a few minor attractions in the afternoon but were hoping for more success
in the days to come. <A HREF="bestirishwalks.shtml"><IMG SRC="/~wilsonp/images/photos/travel/ireland/2.jpg" HEIGHT=317 WIDTH=200 ALIGN=LEFT></A>We
did learn that nearby Millstreet was hosting a large festival the next
day. Unfortunately, when we arrived in Millstreet during a monsoon, the
festival was really a big concert with many bands we had never heard, mostly
outside (in the rain), and cost about &pound;25 (while this may only be
$45 CDN ~ $35 US, it is nearly 75 DM, the currency we now live in). It
was then that we decided to skip our planned stop-over in Macroom for the
night, expecting that this inland village would have little to offer in
the middle of a rainstorm.</P>

<P>Killarney was a great place to spend the rainy day as it had many shops
for us to visit and in which to hunt for bargains. We were successful:
I got a nice waxed-cotton jacket. After a couple of hours of shopping,
we <A HREF="killarney.shtml">hit the road</A> for Glengarrif, a small village
at the tip of Bantry Bay in south-west Ireland. It was now Sunday night
and we had spent over 50 hours in Ireland with little more than a waxed
cotton jacket to show for it! In fact, the best part of these first two
days was the purchase of a book entitled "<A HREF="bestirishwalks.shtml">The
Best Irish Walks</A>." While we had come to Ireland expecting to do lots
of walking and hiking, it was this book which gave us the inspiration to
search out the various hikes to come.</P>
