   <h3><a href=travel>Travel</a></h3>

   One of our most favourite hobbies is to travel to new countries and
   cities and explore. When we lived in Germany, we were able to
   pursue this hobby with new vigour. In addition to our new
   experiences in Germany itself, we have visited a number of
   different European countries, from Spain to Austria, Ireland to
   Italy. In some of these places, we have been lucky enough to have
   our own personal tour guides, friends which we have met elsewhere
   and are reunited with in their home town. In most of these places,
   we get a very special taste of the culture directly through a
   sampling of the food.

   These pages are the on-line version of the travelogues which I
   began writing to send electronically to my family and
   friends. Unfortunately, I started writing them before I decided to
   put them on-line, so I don't have originals of them all. If you see
   a destination below without a travelogue, and you are lucky enough
   to have a copy, please send it back to me!
