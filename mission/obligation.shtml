   <hr><p>

   <span id=highlight>I, Paul Philip Hood Wilson</span> in the
   presence of these my betters and my equals in my Calling, bind
   myself upon my Honour and Cold Iron, that, to the best of my
   knowledge and power, I will not henceforward suffer or pass, or be
   privy to the passing of, Bad Workmanship or Faulty Material in
   aught that concerns my works before mankind as an Engineer, or in
   my dealings with my own Soul before my Maker.
   <p>

   <span id=highlight>MY TIME</span> I will not refuse; my Thought I
   will not grudge; my Care I will not deny towards the honour, use,
   stability and perfection of any works to which I may be called to
   set my hand.
   <p>

   <span id=highlight>MY FAIR WAGES</span> for that work I will openly take.  My Reputation in
   my Calling I will honourably guard; but I will in no way go about
   to compass or wrest judgment or gratification from any one with
   whom I may deal.  And further, I will early and warily strive my
   uttermost against professional jealousy or the belittling of my
   working-colleagues in any field of their labour.
   <p>

   <span id=highlight>FOR MY ASSURED FAILURES</span> and derelictions, I ask pardon beforehand
   of my betters and my equals in my Calling here assembled; praying
   that in the hour of my temptations, weakness and weariness, the
   memory of this my Obligation and of the company before whom it was
   entered into, may return to me to aid, comfort and restrain.
