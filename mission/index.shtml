   <h3>Mission</h3>
   <b>To contribute to the joy and improvement of all those around me.</b>

   <h3>Vision</h3>
   <b>I am joyful with where I am in life while still working to
   increase and share that joy.  I display an obvious comittment and
   sense of integrity in both my teaching and research.  I always act
   with compassion towards others.</b>

<span id=highlight>Background</span><p>

In June 2001, I attended a career skills workshop that focused on
goal setting and achieving balance in one's life.  The presenters,
Dr. Carolyn Hines and Mr. William Hines, Jr, encouraged us to each
develop a personal vision and mission statement and then use these
to guide our goal setting.  Additionally, they introduced the
"Wheel of Life" concept in order to help us measure the balance
in our lives and then focus our goal setting on achieving that
balance.
<p>

My personal vision and mission statement developed out of a few core
values combined with my definition of success.  Those core values are
<b><i>integrity, selflessness, comittment, joy,</i></b> and 
<b><i>compassion</i></b>.  In addition, to me, a successful person is
one who is continually improving themselves and their contribution to
society - although I am pretty open to what form that contribution
takes.
<p>

Two of these core values are represented in the <a
